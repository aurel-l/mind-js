Stand, ho! Who’s there?   \n \nEnter HORATIO and MARCELLUS.\n   \nHORATIO:  Friends to this ground [Friends to Elsinore].\nMARCELLUS:  And liegemen to the Dane [loyal subjects of the king].            20\nFRANCISCO:  Give you good-night.   \nMARCELLUS:  O! farewell, honest soldier:   \nWho hath reliev’d you?   \nFRANCISCO:  Bernardo has my place.   \nGive you good-night.  [Exit.            25\nMARCELLUS:  Holla! [Hello!] Bernardo!\nBERNARDO:  Say,   \nWhat! is Horatio there?   \nHORATIO:  A piece of him.\n[piece of him: Horatio is only half-awake.]   \nBERNARDO:  Welcome, Horatio; welcome, good Marcellus.            30\nMARCELLUS:  What! has this thing appear’d again to-night?   \nBERNARDO:  I have seen nothing.   \nMARCELLUS:  Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,   \nAnd will not let belief take hold of him   \nTouching this dreaded sight twice seen of us:            35\nTherefore I have entreated him along   \nWith us to watch the minutes of this night;   \nThat if again this apparition come,   \nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.   \nHORATIO:  Tush, tush! ’twill not appear.            40\nBERNARDO:  Sit down a while,   \nAnd let us once again assail your ears,\n[assail . . . ears: Tell you; fill your ears]  \nThat are so fortified against our story,   \nWhat we two nights have seen.   \nHORATIO:  Well, sit we down,            45\nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.   \nBERNARDO:  Last night of all,   \nWhen yond same star that’s westward from the pole\n[yond: Yonder; star: North Star, on the outer edge of the Little Dipper.]  \nHad made his course to illume that part of heaven   \nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,            50\nThe bell then beating one,—   \nMARCELLUS:  Peace! break thee off; look, where it comes again!   \n \nEnter Ghost.\n   \nBERNARDO:  In the same figure, like the king that’s dead.\n[the king: Old King Hamlet, who was murdered]   \nMARCELLUS:  Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.            55\nBERNARDO:  Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.   \nHORATIO:  Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.   \nBERNARDO:  It would be spoke to.   \nMARCELLUS:  Question it, Horatio.   \nHORATIO:  What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,            60\nTogether with that fair and war-like form   \nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark\n[buried Denmark: The buried king]   \nDid sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!   \nMARCELLUS:  It is offended.   \nBERNARDO:  See! it stalks away.            65\nHORATIO:  Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!  [Exit Ghost.   \nMARCELLUS:  ’Tis gone, and will not answer.   \nBERNARDO:  How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:   \nIs not this something more than fantasy?   \nWhat think you on ’t?            70\nHORATIO:  Before my God, I might not this believe   \nWithout the sensible and true avouch [testimony]   \nOf mine own eyes.   \nMARCELLUS:  Is it not like the king?   \nHORATIO:  As thou art to thyself:            75\nSuch was the very armour he had on   \nWhen he the ambitious Norway [king of Norway] combated;\nSo frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle [parley] ,\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\n[smote . . . ice: Struck his poleax (long-handled battle-axe) on the ice]  \n’Tis strange.            80\nMARCELLUS:  Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\n[jump . . . hour: At this very same hour]   \nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n[martial stalk: The walk of a warrior]   \nHORATIO:  In what particular thought to work I know not;   \nBut in the gross and scope of my opinion,\n[in . . . opinion: Overall I think]   \nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.            85\nMARCELLUS:  Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,   \nWhy this same strict and most observant watch   \nSo nightly toils the subject of the land;   \nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon,   \nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;            90\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task   \nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;   \nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste   \nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:   \nWho is ’t that can inform me?            95\n[Why this . . . inform me: Why are we keeping this nightly watch up here on the castle? Why are our artisans hard at work every day making cannons, why is our country so busy buying weapons of war, and why are we hiring so many men to build ships? Why is everyone working in such a sweat, day and night. Who can tell me?]\nHORATIO:  That can I;   \nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king [King Hamlet],\nWhose image even but now appear’d to us,   \nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,   \nThereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,            100\n[prick'd . . . pride: Goaded on by a most ambitious pride]\nDar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—   \nFor so this side of our known world esteem’d him—   \nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d compact,   \nWell ratified by law and heraldry,   \nDid forfeit with his life all those his lands            105\nWhich he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;   \nAgainst the which, a moiety competent [reasonable portion] \nWas gaged [pledged] by our king; which had return’d   \nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,   \nHad he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,            110\nAnd carriage of the article design’d,   \nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,   \nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,   \nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there   \nShark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,            115\n[Shark'd . . . resolutes: Recruited hoodlums]\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise   \nThat hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other—   \nAs it doth well appear unto our state—   \nBut to recover of us, by strong hand   \nAnd terms compulsative, those foresaid lands            120\n[terms compulsative: Terms forced on Elsinore]\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,   \nIs the main motive of our preparations,   \nThe source of this our watch and the chief head   \nOf this post-haste and romage [heightened activity] in the land.\nBERNARDO:  I think it be no other but e’en so;            125\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure [the ghost]\nComes armed through our watch, so like the king   \nThat was and is the question of these wars.   \nHORATIO:  A mote [speck] it is to trouble the mind’s eye.   \nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,            130\nA little ere [before] the mightiest Julius [Julius Caesar] fell,   \nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead   \nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   \nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,   \nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star [moon]           135\nUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands\n[Upon . . . stands: The seas make up the empire of Neptune, the god of the sea in Roman mythology. The ebb and flow of the tides depend on the gravitational pull of the moon.] \nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse;   \nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,   \nAs harbingers preceding still the fates   \nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,            140\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated   \nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\n[And even . . . countrymen: Denmark is experiencing the same kind of ill omens that preceded Caesar's assassination.]  \nBut, soft! [soft: Pay attention; stand at attention; take note] behold! lo! where it comes again.   \n \nRe-enter Ghost.\n   \nI’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!            145\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,   \nSpeak to me:   \nIf there be any good thing to be done,   \nThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,   \nSpeak to me:            150\nIf thou art privy to thy country’s fate,   \nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid,   \nO! speak;   \nOr if thou hast uphoarded [hoarded, stored up] in thy life   \nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,            155\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,  [Cock crows.   \nSpeak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.   \nMARCELLUS:  Shall I strike at it with my partisan [long-shafted weapon mounted with a blade]?   \nHORATIO:  Do, if it will not stand.   \nBERNARDO: ’Tis here!            160\nHORATIO:  ’Tis here!  [Exit Ghost.   \nMARCELLUS:  ’Tis gone!   \nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,   \nTo offer it the show of violence;   \nFor it is, as the air, invulnerable,            165\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.   \nBERNARDO:  It was about to speak when the cock crew [crowed].   \nHORATIO:  And then it started like a guilty thing   \nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard,   \nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,            170\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat   \nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,   \nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,   \nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies [runs off] \nTo his confine; and of the truth herein            175\nThis present object made probation [proof].   \nMARCELLUS:  It faded on the crowing of the cock.   \nSome say that ever ’gainst that season comes   \nWherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,   \nThe bird of dawning [rooster] singeth all night long;            180\nAnd then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;   \nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,   \nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,   \nSo hallow’d and so gracious is the time.   \nHORATIO:  So have I heard and do in part believe it.            185\nBut, look, the morn in russet mantle clad,   \nWalks o’er the dew of yon high eastern hill;   \nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice   \nLet us impart what we have seen to-night   \nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,            190\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.   \nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,   \nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?   \nMARCELLUS:  Let’s do ’t, I pray; and I this morning know   \nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.

So much for him.   \nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting.   \nThus much the business is: we have here writ   \nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,            30\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears   \nOf this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress   \nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,   \nThe lists and full proportions, are all made   \nOut of his subject; and we here dispatch            35\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,   \nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   \nGiving to you no further personal power   \nTo business with the king more than the scope   \nOf these delated [outlined] articles allow.            40\nFarewell and let your haste commend your duty.   \nCORNELIUS and VOLTIMAND:  In that and all things will we show our duty.   \nKING:  We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.  [Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS.   \nAnd now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?   \nYou told us of some suit; what is ’t, Laertes?            45\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,   \nAnd lose your voice; what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,   \nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?   \nThe head is not more native to the heart,   \nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,            50\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.   \nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?   \nLAERTES:  Dread my lord,\n[Dread my lord: Dreaded lord; esteemed lord; great lord] \nYour leave and favour to return to France;   \nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark,            55\nTo show my duty in your coronation,   \nYet now, I must confess, that duty done,   \nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France   \nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.   \nKING:  Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?            60\nPOLONIUS:  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave   \nBy laboursome petition, and at last   \nUpon his will I seal’d my hard consent:   \nI do beseech you, give him leave to go.   \nKING:  Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,            65\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will.   \nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,—   \nHAMLET:  [Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind. [In an aside, a character lowers his voice or whispers so that another character (or other characters) onstage cannot hear him. Sometimes, the speaker of an aside allows a friend or someone else near him to hear the aside.]\nKING:  How is it that the clouds still hang on you?   \nHAMLET:  Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun.            70\n[I am . . . sun: A pun. Hamlet is subtly intimating that he does not like being the son, or stepson, of Claudius.]\nQUEEN:  Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,   \nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.   \nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids   \nSeek for thy noble father [old Hamlet] in the dust:   \nThou know’st ’tis common; all that live must die,            75\nPassing through nature to eternity.   \nHAMLET:  Ay, madam, it is common.   \nQUEEN:  If it be,   \nWhy seems it so particular with thee?   \nHAMLET:  Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not ‘seems.’            80\n’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,   \nNor customary suits of solemn black,   \nNor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,   \nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,   \nNor the dejected haviour [appearance] of the visage,            85\nTogether with all forms, modes, shows of grief,   \nThat can denote me truly; these indeed seem,   \nFor they are actions that a man might play:   \nBut I have that within which passeth show;\n[But . . . show: No one can see what I am thinking or feeling.] \nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.            90\nKING:  ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,   \nTo give these mourning duties to your father:   \nBut, you must know, your father lost a father;   \nThat father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound   \nIn filial obligation for some term            95\nTo do obsequious sorrow; but to persevere  \nIn obstinate condolement [mourning] is a course   \nOf impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief:   \nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,   \nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,            100\nAn understanding simple and unschool’d:   \nFor what we know must be and is as common   \nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,   \nWhy should we in our peevish opposition   \nTake it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven,            105\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,   \nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme   \nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,   \nFrom the first corse [corpse] till he that died to-day,   \n‘This must be so.’ We pray you, throw to earth            110\nThis unprevailing woe, and think of us   \nAs of a father; for let the world take note,   \nYou are the most immediate to our throne;   \nAnd with no less nobility of love   \nThan that which dearest father bears his son            115\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent   \nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,   \nIt is most retrograde [contrary] to our desire;   \nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remain   \nHere, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,            120\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.   \nQUEEN:  Let not thy mother lose her prayers, \"Hamlet\":   \nI pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.   \nHAMLET:  I shall in all my best obey you, madam.   \nKING:  Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply:            125\nBe as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;   \nThis gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet   \nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,   \nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,   \nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,            130\nAnd the king’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again,   \nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. \n[ No jocund . . . thunder: The great cannon shall boom to the skies while I drink a toast that heaven itself shall hear resound again and again, echoing like earthly thunder.]\n[Exeunt all except HAMLET.  \nHAMLET:  O! that this too too solid flesh would melt,   \nThaw and resolve itself into a dew;   \nOr that the Everlasting had not fix’d            135\nHis canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!  \n[Or that . . . slaughter: Or that God had not forbade suicide.]\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable   \nSeem to me all the uses of this world.   \nFie on ’t! O fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,   \nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature            140\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!   \nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:   \nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,   \nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother   \n[Hyperion: Father of Helios, the sun god in Greek mythology; satyr: In Greek mythology, a lecherous, goatlike man]\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven            145\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!   \nMust I remember? why, she would hang on him,   \nAs if increase of appetite had grown   \nBy what it fed on; and yet, within a month,   \nLet me not think on ’t: Frailty, thy name is woman!            150\nA little month; or ere those shoes were old   \nWith which she follow’d my poor father’s body,   \nLike Niobe, all tears; why she, even she,—   \nO God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,   \nWould have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,            155\nMy father’s brother, but no more like my father   \nThan I to Hercules: within a month,   \nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears   \nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,   \nShe married.

Marcellus?           170\nMARCELLUS:  My good lord,—   \nHAMLET:  I am very glad to see you.  [To BERNARDO.]  Good even, sir.   \nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?   \nHORATIO:  A truant [lazy; idle] disposition, good my lord [my good lord].            175\nHAMLET:  I would not hear your enemy say so,   \nNor shall you do mine ear that violence,   \nTo make it truster of your own report   \nAgainst yourself; I know you are no truant.   \nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?            180\nWe’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.   \nHORATIO:  My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.   \nHAMLET:  I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;   \nI think it was to see my mother’s wedding.   \nHORATIO:  Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.            185\nHAMLET:  Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral bak’d meats   \nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\n[the funeral bak'd . . . tables: The marriage took place so soon after the death of old Hamlet that food from the funeral was served at the wedding reception.]   \nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven   \nEre [before] I had ever seen that day, Horatio!   \nMy father, methinks I see my father.            190\nHORATIO:  O! where, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  In my mind’s eye, Horatio.   \nHORATIO:  I saw him once; he was a goodly king.  \nHAMLET:  He was a man, take him for all in all,   \nI shall not look upon his like again.            195\nHORATIO:  My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.   \nHAMLET:  Saw who?   \nHORATIO:  My lord, the king your father.   \nHAMLET:  The king, my father!   \nHORATIO:  Season your admiration for a while            200\nWith an attent [attentive] ear, till I may deliver,   \nUpon the witness of these gentlemen,   \nThis marvel to you.   \nHAMLET:  For God’s love, let me hear.   \nHORATIO:  Two nights together had these gentlemen,            205\nMarcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,   \nIn the dead vast and middle of the night,   \nBeen thus encounter’d: a figure like your father,   \nArmed at points exactly, cap-a-pe [variant spelling of cap-a-pie, meaning from head to toe],   \nAppears before them, and with solemn march            210\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d   \nBy their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,   \nWithin his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d\n[truncheon's length: The apparition was no farther from them than the length of a truncheon, a staff symbolizing a king's authority.]  \nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,   \nStand dumb and speak not to him. This to me            215\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,   \nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch;   \nWhere, as they had deliver’d, both in time,   \nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,   \nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;            220\nThese hands are not more like.   \nHAMLET:  But where was this?   \nMARCELLUS:  My lord, upon the platform [floor surrounded by battlements] where we watch’d.   \nHAMLET:  Did you not speak to it?   \nHORATIO:  My lord, I did;            225\nBut answer made it none; yet once methought   \nIt lifted up its head and did address   \nItself to motion, like as it would speak;   \nBut even then the morning cock crew [crowed] loud,   \nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away            230\nAnd vanish’d from our sight.   \nHAMLET:  ’Tis very strange.   \nHORATIO:  As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;   \nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty   \nTo let you know of it.            235\nHAMLET:  Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.   \nHold you the watch to-night?   \nMARCELLUS and BERNARDO:  We do, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Arm’d, say you?   \nMARCELLUS and BERNARDO:  Arm’d, my lord.            240\nHAMLET:  From top to toe?   \nMARCELLUS and BERNARDO:  My lord, from head to foot.   \nHAMLET:  Then saw you not his face?   \nHORATIO:  O yes! my lord; he wore his beaver up.\n[beaver: Shield on the helmet of a suit of armor. The beaver protects the face. It can be raised on hinges.]  \nHAMLET:  What! look’d he frowningly?            245\nHORATIO:  A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.   \nHAMLET:  Pale or red?   \nHORATIO:  Nay, very pale.   \nHAMLET:  And fix’d his eyes upon you?   \nHORATIO:  Most constantly.            250\nHAMLET:  I would I had been there.   \nHORATIO:  It would have much amaz’d you.   \nHAMLET:  Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?   \nHORATIO:  While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.   \nMARCELLUS and BERNARDO:  Longer, longer.            255\nHORATIO:  Not when I saw it.   \nHAMLET:  His beard was grizzled, no?   \nHORATIO:  It was, as I have seen it in his life,   \nA sable silver’d [black beard with silver hairs].   \nHAMLET:  I will watch to-night;            260\nPerchance ’twill walk again.   \nHORATIO:  I warrant it will.   \nHAMLET:  If it assume my noble father’s person,   \nI’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape   \nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,            265\nIf you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,   \nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\n[Let . . . still: Don't tell anyone about it.] \nAnd whatsoever else shall hap [happen] to-night,   \nGive it an understanding, but no tongue:   \nI will requite your loves. So, fare you well.            270\n[requite . . . loves: Pay you back.]\nUpon the platform, ’twixt [between] eleven and twelve,   \nI’ll visit you.   \nALL:  Our duty to your honour.   \nHAMLET:  Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.  [Exeunt HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.   \nMy father’s spirit in arms! all is not well;            275\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!   \nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,   \nThough all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.

Now, Hamlet, \"hear\":   \n’Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,   \nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark   \nIs by a forged process of my death   \nRankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth,            45\nThe serpent that did sting thy father’s life   \nNow wears his crown.   \nHAMLET: O my prophetic soul!   \nMy uncle!   \nGHOST:  Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,            50\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—   \nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power   \nSo to seduce!—won to his shameful lust   \nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.   \nO Hamlet! what a falling-off was there;            55\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity   \nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow   \nI made to her in marriage; and to decline   \nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   \nTo those of mine!            60\nBut virtue, as it never will be mov’d,   \nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\n[lewdness . . . heaven: The Ghost says Claudius was lewd but pretended to be upright.]  \nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,   \nWill sate itself in a celestial bed,   \nAnd prey on garbage.            65\nBut, soft! [soft: Pay attention; stand at attention; take note] methinks I scent the morning air;   \nBrief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard,   \nMy custom always in the afternoon,   \nUpon my secure hour [leisure time] thy uncle stole,   \nWith juice of cursed hebona [poisonous plant] in a vial,            70\nAnd in the porches of mine ears did pour   \nThe leperous distilment; whose effect   \nHolds such an enmity with blood of man   \nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through   \nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,            75\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset [curdle; coagulate]\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,   \nThe thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;   \nAnd a most instant tetter [skin eruption] bark’d about,   \nMost lazar-like [leprous], with vile and loathsome crust,            80\nAll my smooth body.   \nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand,   \nOf life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d [robbed];   \nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,   \nUnhousel’d, disappointed, unanel’d,             85\n[Unhousel'd . . . unanel'd: Unhousel'd: not given the Holy Eucharist. Unanel'd: not given the last rites of the Catholic Church]\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account   \nWith all my imperfections on my head:   \nO, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!   \nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;   \nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be            90\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.   \nBut, howsoever thou pursu’st this act,   \nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive   \nAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,   \nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,            95\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!   \nThe glow-worm [beetle that glows like a firefly] shows the matin [morning] to be near,   \nAnd ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire;   \nAdieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.  [Exit.   \n  HAMLET:  O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?            100\nAnd shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart!   \nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,   \nBut bear me stiffly up! Remember thee!   \nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat   \nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee!            105\nYea, from the table of my memory   \nI’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,   \nAll saws [wise sayings] of books, all forms, all pressures past,   \nThat youth and observation copied there;   \nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live            110\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\n[thy . . . brain: My only thought will be to gain revenge.]   \nUnmix’d with baser matter: yes, by heaven!   \nO most pernicious woman!   \nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!   \nMy tables [notes],—meet it is I set [write] it down,            115\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;   \nAt least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark:  [Writing.   \nSo, uncle, there you are.

Touching this vision here,   \nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you;            155\nFor your desire to know what is between us,   \nO’ermaster ’t [control it; master it] as you may. And now, good friends,   \nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,   \nGive me one poor request.   \nHORATIO:  What is ’t, my lord? we will.            160\nHAMLET:  Never make known what you have seen to-night.   \nHORATIO: and MARCELLUS:  My lord, we will not.   \nHAMLET:  Nay, but swear ’t.   \nHORATIO:  In faith,   \nMy lord, not I.            165\nMARCELLUS:  Nor I, my lord, in faith.   \nHAMLET:  Upon my sword.\n[A sword   \nMARCELLUS:  We have sworn, my lord, already.   \nHAMLET:  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.   \nGHOST:  [Beneath.]  Swear.            170\n[Beneath: The voice of the ghost is coming from under the stage.]\nHAMLET:  Ah, ha, boy! sayst thou so? art thou there, true-penny [trustworthy person]?   \nCome on,—you hear this fellow in the cellar-age [below, in the cellar],—   \nConsent to swear.   \nHORATIO: Propose the oath, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Never to speak of this that you have seen,            175\nSwear by my sword.   \nGHOST:  [Beneath.]  Swear.   \nHAMLET:  Hic et ubique? [Latin: Here and everywhere] Then we’ll shift our ground.   \nCome hither, gentlemen,   \nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword:            180\nNever to speak of this that you have heard,   \nSwear by my sword.\n[Swearing on a sword was like swearing on a cross. The handle, crossguard, and blade of a sword are in the shape of a cross.]  \nGHOST:  [Beneath.]  Swear.   \nHAMLET:  Well said, old mole! canst work i’ the earth so fast?   \nA worthy pioner! [miner] Once more remove, good friends.            185\nHORATIO:  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!   \nHAMLET:  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.   \nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,   \nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.   \nBut come;            190\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,   \nHow strange or odd soe’er [whatsoever] I bear myself,   \nAs I perchance hereafter shall think meet   \nTo put an antic disposition on,\n[As I . . . on: Hereafter I think I shall pretend to be odd, clownish, a bit crazy.] \nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,            195\nWith arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,   \nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,   \nAs, ‘Well, well, we know,’ or, ‘We could, an if we would;’   \nOr, ‘If we list to speak,’ or, ‘There be, an if they might;’   \nOr such ambiguous giving out, to note            200\nThat you know aught of me: this not to do,   \nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you,   \nSwear.   \nGHOST:  [Beneath.]  Swear.

Long stay’d he so;   \nAt last, a little shaking of mine arm,   \nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,            105\nHe rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound   \nThat it did seem to shatter all his bulk   \nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,   \nAnd, with his head over his shoulder turn’d,   \nHe seem’d to find his way without his eyes;            110\nFor out o’ doors he went without their help,   \nAnd to the last bended their light on me.   \nPOLONIUS:  Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.   \nThis is the very ecstasy of love,   \nWhose violent property fordoes itself            115\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings   \nAs oft as any passion under heaven   \nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.   \nWhat! have you given him any hard words of late?   \nOPHELIA:  No, my good lord; but, as you did command,            120\nI did repel his letters and denied   \nHis access to me.   \nPOLONIUS:  That hath made him mad.   \nI am sorry that with better heed and judgment   \nI had not quoted [studied closely] him; I fear’d he did but trifle,            125\nAnd meant to wrack [ruin, ravish] thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!   \nBy heaven, it is as proper to our age   \nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions   \nAs it is common for the younger sort   \nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:            130\nThis must be known; which, being kept close, might move   \nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.   \nCome.  [Exeunt]",

[Exit POLONIUS.   \nHe tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found            60\nThe head and source of all your son’s distemper.   \nQUEEN:  I doubt it is no other but the main;   \nHis father’s death, and our o’erhasty marriage.   \nKING:  Well, we shall sift [watch, observe] him.   \n \nRe-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS.             65\n\nWelcome, my good friends!   \nSay, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?   \nVOLTIMAND:  Most fair return of greetings, and desires.   \nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress   \nHis nephew’s levies [recruitment of men into the army], which to him appear’d            70\nTo be a preparation ’gainst the Polack [Pole];   \nBut, better look’d into, he truly found   \nIt was against your highness: whereat griev’d,   \nThat so his sickness, age, and impotence   \nWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests            75\nOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,   \nReceives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,   \nMakes vow before his uncle never more   \nTo give the assay of arms against your majesty.\n[To give . . . arms: To make war]   \nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,            80\nGives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,   \nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,   \nSo levied as before, against the Polack [Pole];   \nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,  [Giving a paper.   \nThat it might please you to give quiet pass            85\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,   \nOn such regards of safety and allowance   \nAs therein are set down.   \nKING: It likes us well;   \nAnd at our more consider’d time we’ll read,            90\nAnswer, and think upon this business:   \nMeantime we thank you for your well-took labour.   \nGo to your rest; at night we’ll feast together:   \nMost welcome home.  [Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS.   \nPOLONIUS: This business is well ended.            95\nMy liege, and madam, to expostulate   \nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,   \nWhy day is day, night night, and time is time,   \nWere nothing but to waste night, day, and time.   \nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,            100\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,   \nI will be brief. Your noble son is mad:   \nMad call I it; for, to define true madness,   \nWhat is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?   \nBut let that go.            105\nQUEEN:  More matter, with less art.\n[More . . . art: Give specific details, but avoid being wordy.] \nPOLONIUS:  Madam, I swear I use no art [embellishment; wordiness] at all.   \nThat he is mad, ’tis true; ’tis true ’tis pity;   \nAnd pity ’tis ’tis true: a foolish figure;   \nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.            110\nMad let us grant him, then; and now remains   \nThat we find out the cause of this effect,   \nOr rather say, the cause of this defect,   \nFor this effect defective comes by cause;   \nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.            115\nPerpend [be attentive; consider carefully what I say].   \nI have a daughter, have while she is mine;   \nWho, in her duty and obedience, mark,   \nHath given me this [letter, note]: now, gather, and surmise [figure out its meaning].   \n\nPolonius reads from the letter\n\n\"To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia.—\"            120\nThat’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; \"beautified\" is a vile phrase; but you shall hear. Thus:   \n\"In her excellent white bosom, these,\" &c. [etc.]—   \nQUEEN:  Came this from Hamlet to her?   \nPOLONIUS:  Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.   \n        \"Doubt thou the stars are fire;            125\n          Doubt that the sun doth move;   \n        Doubt truth to be a liar;   \n          But never doubt I love.   \n\"O dear Ophelia! I am ill at these numbers [verses, lines of poetry]:   \nI have not art to reckon [express] my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best! believe it. Adieu [Farewell].            130\nThine evermore, most dear lady, whilst\nthis machine is to him [machine . . . him: Body is mine], HAMLET.\"  \nThis in obedience hath my daughter shown me;   \nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,   \nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,   \nAll given to mine ear.            135\nKING:  But how hath she   \nReceiv’d his love?   \nPOLONIUS:  What do you think of me?   \nKING:  As of a man faithful and honourable.   \nPOLONIUS:  I would fain [willingly] prove so. But what might you think,            140\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing,—   \nAs I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that,   \nBefore my daughter told me,—what might you,   \nOr my dear majesty, your queen here, think,   \nIf I had play’d the desk or table-book,            145\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,   \nOr look’d upon this love with idle sight;   \nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\n[I would fain . . . round to work: I would willingly prove so. But what would you think—when I saw their relationship developing— if I had helped them by leaving love letters on a desk or placing them between the pages of a book left on a table. What would you think If stood idly by without taking action?  The fact is, I did take action. I went to work against allowing this relationship to continue.]\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:   \n‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;            150\nThis must not be:’ and then I precepts gave her,   \nThat she should lock herself from his resort,   \nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.   \nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice;   \nAnd he, repulsed,—a short tale to make,—            155\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,   \nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,   \nThence to a lightness; and by this declension   \nInto the madness wherein now he raves,   \nAnd all we wail for.            160\nKING:  Do you think ’tis this?   \nQUEEN:  It may be, very likely.   \nPOLONIUS:  Hath there been such a time,—I’d fain [happily; gladly] know that,—   \nThat I have positively said, ‘’Tis so,’   \nWhen it prov’d otherwise?            165\nKING:  Not that I know.   \nPOLONIUS:  Take this from this, if this be otherwise:  [Pointing to his head and shoulder.   \nIf circumstances lead me, I will find   \nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed   \nWithin the centre [center of the earth].            170\nKING:  How may we try it further?   \nPOLONIUS:  You know sometimes he walks four hours together   \nHere in the lobby.   \nQUEEN:  So he does indeed.   \nPOLONIUS:  At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him;            175\nBe you and I behind an arras [curtain; tapestry] then;   \nMark the encounter; if he love her not,   \nAnd be not from his reason fallen thereon,   \nLet me be no assistant for a state,   \nBut keep a farm, and carters [drivers of carts].            180\nKING:  We will try it.   \nQUEEN:  But look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.   \nPOLONIUS:  Away! I do beseech you, both away.   \nI’ll board [confront] him presently.  [Exeunt KING, QUEEN, and Attendants.  \n\nEnter HAMLET, reading.             185\n\nO! give me leave.   \nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?   \nHAMLET:  Well, God a-mercy.   \nPOLONIUS:  Do you know me, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Excellent well; you are a fishmonger [fish merchant].            190\nPOLONIUS:  Not I, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Then I would you were so honest a man.   \nPOLONIUS:  Honest, my lord!   \nHAMLET:  Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.   \nPOLONIUS:  That’s very true, my lord.            195\nHAMLET:  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter?\n[Hamlet is now pretending to be mad.]  \nPOLONIUS:  I have, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Let her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a blessing; but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to ’t.   \nPOLONIUS:  [Aside.]  How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Words, words, words.            200\nPOLONIUS:  What is the matter, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Between who?   \nPOLONIUS:  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Slanders, \"sir\": for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging [oozing] thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams [knees]: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.   \nPOLONIUS:  [Aside.]  Though this be madness, yet there is method in ’t [end of aside]. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?            205\n[Though . . . method in 't: Though he is mad, there is an intelligent design in his actions.]\nHAMLET:  Into my grave?   \nPOLONIUS:  Indeed, that is out o’ the air.  [Aside.]  How pregnant [clever, meaningful] sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter [end of aside]. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.   \nHAMLET:  You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal; except my life, except my life, except my life.   \nPOLONIUS:  Fare you well, my lord.  [Going.   \nHAMLET:  These tedious old fools!            210\n \nEnter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\n   \nPOLONIUS:  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  [To POLONIUS.]  God save you, sir!  [Exit POLONIUS.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Mine honoured lord!   \nROSENCRANTZ:  My most dear lord!            215\nHAMLET:  My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  As the indifferent [moderately well] children of the earth.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Happy in that we are not over happy;   \nOn Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.   \nHAMLET:  Nor the soles of her shoe?            220\nROSENCRANTZ:  Neither, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Faith, her privates [genital organs] we.   \nHAMLET:  In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true; she is a strumpet [promiscuous woman]. What news?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.            225\nHAMLET:  Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Prison, my lord!   \nHAMLET:  Denmark’s a prison.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Then is the world one.   \nHAMLET:  A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst.            230\nRos  We think not so, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Why, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.   \nHAMLET:  O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.            235\nHAMLET:  A dream itself is but a shadow.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.   \nHAMLET:  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay [faith], I cannot reason.   \nROSENCRANTZ: and GUILDENSTERN:  We’ll wait upon you.   \nHAMLET:  No such matter; I will not [count] you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?            240\nROSENCRANTZ:  To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.   \nHAMLET:  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny [English coin of small value]. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  What should we say, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Why anything, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  To what end, my lord?            245\nHAMLET:  That you must teach me. But let me conjure [appeal to] you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy [agreeableness] of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no!   \nROSENCRANTZ:  [Aside to GUILDENSTERN.]  What say you?   \nHAMLET:  [Aside.]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  My lord, we were sent for.   \nHAMLET:  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult [shed] no feather. I have of late,—but wherefore [why] I know not,—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament [sky], this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence [perfection] of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though, by your smiling, you seem to say so.            250\nROSENCRANTZ:  My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.   \nHAMLET:  Why did you laugh then, when I said, \"man delights not me?\"  \nROSENCRANTZ:  To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted [passed] them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.   \nHAMLET:  He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target [rapier and shield]; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man [actor who can play different parts; character actor] shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ the sere [burst out laughing at the slightest provocation; a sere is a hair trigger] and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse [see the study guide section on blank verse] shall halt for ’t. What players are they?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Even those you were wont to take delight in, tragedians of the city.            255\nHAMLET:  How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\n[their . . .  ways: They were more popular and made more money when in residence in a city.]   \nROSENCRANTZ:  I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.\n[I think . . . innovation: I think they were prohibited after a recent riot.]  \nHAMLET:  Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  No, indeed they are not.   \nHAMLET:  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?            260\nROSENCRANTZ:  Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted [desired] pace: but there is, sir, an aery [nest; group] of children, little eyases [falcons in training], that cry out on the top of the question [top of their voices], and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages,—so they call them,—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.\nHAMLET:  What! are they children? who maintains ’em? how are they escoted [paid]? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players,—as it is most like, if their means are no better,—their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession? \n[if they . . . succession: If they continue to act after they become adults, they will no longer be a novelty.]\nROSENCRANTZ:  Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides: and the nation holds it no sin to tarre [goad] them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for the argument [plot of a play], unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.   \nHAMLET:  Is it possible?   \nGUILDENSTERN:  O! there has been much throwing about of brains.            265\nHAMLET:  Do the boys carry it away?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\n[Hercules . . . too: The image of the mythological hero Hercules bearing the world on his shoulders was a symbol of the Globe Theatre.]   \nHAMLET:  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows [frowns] at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little [small image of the king]. ’Sblood [by the blood of the crucified Christ], there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.  [Flourish of trumpets within.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  There are the players.   \nHAMLET:  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then [let me shake your hands]; the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb [regard], lest my extent [behavior] to the players—which, I tell you, must show fairly outward—should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome; but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.            270\nGUILDENSTERN:  In what, my dear lord?   \nHAMLET:  I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw [heronshaw, a type of wading bird].\n[I know . . . handsaw: I know what's what].   \n \nEnter POLONIUS.\n   \nPOLONIUS:  Well be with you, gentlemen!   \nHAMLET:  Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too; at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts [clothes].            275\nROSENCRANTZ:  Happily he’s the second time come [wearing] to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.\nHAMLET:  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. [Hamlet turns his attention to Polonius.] You say right, sir; o’ Monday morning; ’twas so indeed.   \nPOLONIUS:  My lord, I have news to tell you.   \nHAMLET:  My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius [renowned actor] was an actor in Rome,—   \nPOLONIUS:  The actors are come hither, my lord.            280\nHAMLET:  Buzz, buzz! [Buzz means old news. It is also the equivalent of \"zzzzzzz\" to suggest sleeping. In other words, Hamlet thinks he is about to be bored or put to sleep, so to speak, by what Polonius says.] \nPOLONIUS:  Upon my honour,—   \nHAMLET:  Then came each actor on his ass,—   \nPOLONIUS:  The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable [scene that preserves the classical unities of time, place, and action], or poem unlimited: Seneca [ancient Roman tragedian] cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus [ancient Roman writer of comedies] too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.   \nHAMLET:  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!            285\nPOLONIUS:  What a treasure had he, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Why   \n        One fair daughter and no more,   \n        The which he loved passing well.   \nPOLONIUS:  [Aside.]  Still on my daughter.            290\n[Hamlet's reference to Jephthah's daughter leads Polonius to conclude that Hamlet is thinking about Ophelia.]\nHAMLET:  Am I not i’ the right, old Jephthah?   \nPOLONIUS:  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.   \nHAMLET:  Nay, that follows not.   \nPOLONIUS:  What follows, then, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Why,            295\n                As by lot, God wot [knew].   \nAnd then, you know,   \n        It came to pass, as most like it was.—   \nThe first row of the pious chanson [pious poem or song] will show you more; for look where my abridgment comes.\n[abridgement: This word may mean entertainment. It may also mean that the players abridge—that is, cut off or shorten—Hamlet's conversation with Polonius.]   \n \nEnter four or five Players.             300\n\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well: welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanced [bearded] since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What! my young lady and mistress! By ’r lady [By the Blessed Virgin Mary], your ladyship [boy who plays women's parts] is nearer heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine [shoe with a thick sole]. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold [gold coin], be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ’t [take to it] like French falconers, fly at anything we see: we’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech.   \nFIRST PLAYER:  What speech, my good lord?   \nHAMLET:  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above [more than] once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; ’twas caviar to the general [the general public did not appreciate caviar]: but it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets [salads or delicious treats] in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved; ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see:—   \nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—   \n’tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:—            305\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he, whose sable arm,   \nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble   \nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse [Trojan horse],   \nHath now this dread and black complexion smear’d   \nWith heraldry more dismal; head to foot            310\nNow is he total gules [red]; horridly trick’d   \nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,   \nBak’d and impasted [encrusted with the residue of the burning city of Troy] with the parching streets,   \nThat lend a tyrannous and damned light   \nTo their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,            315\nAnd thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,   \nWith eyes like carbuncles [red gems], the hellish Pyrrhus   \nOld grandsire Priam seeks.   \nSo proceed you.   \nPOLONIUS:  ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken; with good accent and good discretion.            320\nFIRST PLAYER:  Anon [soon], he finds him   \nStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,   \nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,   \nRepugnant to command. Unequal match’d,   \nPyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;            325\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword   \nThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium [Troy],   \nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top   \nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash   \nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear: for lo! his sword,            330\nWhich was declining on the milky head   \nOf reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick:   \nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,   \nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,   \nDid nothing.            335\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,   \nA silence in the heavens, the rack [clouds] stand still,   \nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below   \nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder   \nDoth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,            340\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;   \nAnd never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall   \nOn Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof [impenetrability] eterne [eternal],   \nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword   \nNow falls on Priam.            345\nOut, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,   \nIn general synod, take away her power;   \nBreak all the spokes and fellies [parts of a rim] from her wheel,   \nAnd bowl the round nave [wheel hub] down the hill of heaven,   \nAs low as to the fiends!            350\nPOLONIUS:  This is too long.   \nHAMLET:  It shall to the barber’s, with your beard. Prithee [I pray you], say on: he’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry [dirty story], or he sleeps [becomes bored]. Say on; come to Hecuba.   \nFIRST PLAYER:  But who, O! who had seen the mobled [wrapped up, enshrouded] queen—   \nHAMLET:  \"The mobled queen?\"—   \nPOLONIUS:  That’s good; \"mobled queen\" is good.            355\nFIRST PLAYER:  Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames   \nWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\n[bisson rheum: Blinding (bisson) discharge (rheum) from the eyes caused by smoke]  \nWhere late the diadem stood; and, for a robe,   \nAbout her lank and all o’er-teemed loins [loins overtaxed or worn out by bearing children]\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;            360\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,   \n’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d:\n[Who . . . pronounc'd: Anyone who had seen Hecuba in this sorry state would have condemned Lady Fortune for her cruelty.] \nBut if the gods themselves did see her then,   \nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport   \nIn mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,            365\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made—   \nUnless things mortal move them not at all—   \nWould have made milch [teary] the burning eyes of heaven,   \nAnd passion in the gods.   \nPOLONIUS:  Look! wh’er [whether] he has not turned his colour and has tears in ’s eyes. Prithee, no more.            370\nHAMLET:  ’Tis well; I’ll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.   \nPOLONIUS:  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.   \nHAMLET:  God’s bodikins [by the body of the Lord], man, much better; use every man after his desert, and who should ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.   \nPOLONIUS:  Come, sirs.   \nHAMLET:  Follow him, \"friends\": we’ll hear a play to-morrow.  [Exit POLONIUS, with all the Players but the First.]  Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago?            375\nFIRST PLAYER:  Ay, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  We’ll ha ’t to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in ’t, could you not?   \nFIRST PLAYER:  Ay, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.  [Exit First Player.]  [To ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.]  My good friends, I’ll leave you till night; you are welcome to Elsinore.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Good my lord!  [Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.            380\nHAMLET:  Ay, so, God be wi’ ye! Now I am alone.   \nO! what a rogue and peasant slave am I:   \nIs it not monstrous that this player here,   \nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion [imagination],   \nCould force his soul so to his own conceit            385\nThat from her working all his visage wann’d,\n[Could force . . . wann'd: Could force his soul to make his face appear pale]\nTears in his eyes, distraction [wild excitement] in his aspect [the way he looks],   \nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting   \nWith forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!   \nFor Hecuba!            390\nWhat’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba   \nThat he should weep for her? What would he do   \nHad he the motive and the cue for passion   \nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears,   \nAnd cleave [pierce] the general ear with horrid speech,            395\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,   \nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed   \nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.   \nYet I,   \nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,            400\n[muddy . . . peak: Man of dubious courage and character who broods]\nLike John-a-dreams [sluggish good-for-nothing], unpregnant of my cause [not full of desire to avenge my father's death],   \nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king,   \nUpon whose property and most dear life   \nA damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?   \nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate [head] across?            405\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?   \nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ the throat,   \nAs deep as to the lungs?

I have heard,   \nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play   \nHave by the very cunning of the scene            425\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently   \nThey have proclaim’d their malefactions [sins; misdeeds];   \nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak   \nWith most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players   \nPlay something like the murder of my father            430\nBefore mine uncle; I’ll observe his looks;   \nI’ll tent [probe] him to the quick [raw flesh beneath the skin]: if he but blench [flinch] \nI know my course.

I’ll have grounds   \nMore relative than this: the play’s the thing   \nWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.  [Exit.            440",

To die, to sleep; \n[To be, or not . . . wish'd: To go on living or end my life: that is the question. Is it nobler to suffer the pain of misfortune or to take action against this pain. Death brings eternal sleep, which supposedly ends suffering. That is an outcome to be wished for.]  \nTo sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub [obstacle; problem];            75\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come   \nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause. There’s the respect   \nThat makes calamity of so long life;   \nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,            80\nThe oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,   \nThe pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,   \nThe insolence of office, and the spurns   \nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,   \nWhen he himself might his quietus make            85\nWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,   \nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,   \nBut that the dread of something after death,   \nThe undiscover’d country from whose bourn   \nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,            90\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have   \nThan fly to others that we know not of?\n[To sleep . . . not of:  The dreams we might have in the sleep of death—in fact, all that happens in the afterlife—is a very intimidating subject. For this reason, people generally choose to live on rather than ending their lives in spite of the severity of the troubles they face. I don't think any person would bear life's problems—scorn, oppression, insolence, love gone wrong, injustice, the arrogance of the high and mighty, rejection—if he could end his life without fear of what would happen next, in the afterlife. But the afterlife is an undiscovered country from whose boundaries no one returns. So, rather than commit suicide and confront the unknown, we choose to stay alive and bear our burdens.]\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;   \nAnd thus the native hue of resolution   \nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,            95\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment   \nWith this regard their currents turn awry,   \nAnd lose the name of action.

I did love thee once.\n[for the power . . . likeness: Beautiful women tend to give in to lust rather than remain chaste.]  \nOPHELIA:  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.   \nHAMLET:  You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.\n[virtue . . . it: We may admire virtue, but we ourselves are anything but virtuous.]\nOPHELIA:  I was the more deceived.   \nHAMLET:  Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? [See Madness: Pretended or Real.] I am myself indifferent [somewhat] honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant [complete] knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?            125\nOPHELIA:  At home, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house. Farewell.   \nOPHELIA:  O! help him, you sweet heavens!   \nHAMLET:  If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters [fools; cuckolds] you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.   \nOPHELIA:  O heavenly powers, restore him!            130\nHAMLET:  I have heard of your paintings [applications of makeup to her face] too, well enough; God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig [dance suggestively], you amble, and you lisp [speak affectedly; speak in a way designed to impress others], and nickname God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on ’t; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages; those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.

There’s something in his soul   \nO’er which his melancholy sits on brood [sits on a scheme or plot, as a hen sits on eggs];   \nAnd, I do doubt, the hatch and the disclose   \nWill be some danger; which for to prevent,            150\nI have in quick determination   \nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England,   \nFor the demand of our neglected tribute:\n[he shall . . . tribute: I will send him to England on the pretense that he is to collect money owed to Denmark.]\nHaply [perhaps] the seas and countries different   \nWith variable objects [sights] shall expel            155\nThis something-settled matter in his heart [the malady that has settled in his heart],   \nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus   \nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on ’t?\n[puts him . . . of himself: Makes him act abnormally]  \nPOLONIUS:  It shall do well: but yet do I believe   \nThe origin and commencement of his grief            160\nSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!   \nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;   \nWe heard it all. My lord, do as you please;   \nBut, if you hold it fit, after the play,   \nLet his queen mother all alone entreat him            165\nTo show his griefs: let her be round with him;   \nAnd I’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear   \nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\n[And I'll . . . conference: And I will hide, then eavesdrop on their conversation.]  \nTo England send him, or confine him where   \nYour wisdom best shall think.            170\nKING:  It shall be so:   \nMadness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand [do not overdo your gestures], thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and—as I may say—whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may give it smoothness. O! it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings [actor in a powdered wig who shouts his lines to the uneducated commoners], who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o’er-doing Termagant [noisy, overbearing, shrewish woman]; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.\nFIRST PLAYER:  I warrant [promise] your honour.   \nHAMLET:  Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O! there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.            5\nFIRST PLAYER:  I hope we have reformed that indifferently [moderately] with us.   \nHAMLET:  O! reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered; that’s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.  [Exeunt Players.   \n \nEnter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN.\n   \nHow now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?   \nPOLONIUS:  And the queen too, and that presently.            10\nHAMLET:  Bid the players make haste.  [Exit POLONIUS.   \nWill you two help to hasten them?   \nROSENCRANTZ: and GUILDENSTERN:  We will, my lord.  [Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.   \nHAMLET:  What, ho!

Why should the poor be flatter’d?   \nNo; let the candied tongue [flatterer] lick absurd pomp,   \nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee [bend the knee]          25\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\n[Where . . .  fawning: Whenever a gain follows his flattery]  \nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice   \nAnd could of men distinguish, her election   \nHath seal’d [chosen] thee for herself; for thou hast been   \nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,            30\n[As . . . nothing: As one who has suffered but does not complain]\nA man that fortune’s buffets and rewards   \nHast ta’en with equal thanks; and bless’d are those   \nWhose blood and judgment are so well comingled   \nThat they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger\n[not . . .  finger: Not controlled by fortune—literally, not a musical instrument (flute) to be played by fortune] \nTo sound what stop [note] she please. Give me that man            35\nThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him   \nIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,   \nAs I do thee. Something too much of this [I'm dwelling too much on this subject.].   \nThere is a play to-night before the king;   \nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance            40\nWhich I have told thee of my father’s death:   \nI prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,   \nEven with the very comment [eye] of thy soul   \nObserve mine uncle; if his occulted [concealed] guilt   \nDo not itself unkennel [reveal itself] in one speech,            45\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen,   \nAnd my imaginations are as foul   \nAs Vulcan’s stithy [the smithy of Vulcan, the blacksmith god in Roman mythology]. Give him heedful note;   \nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face,   \nAnd after we will both our judgments join            50\nIn censure [analysis] of his seeming [reaction; behavior].   \nHORATIO:  Well, my lord:   \nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,   \nAnd ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\n[If . . . theft: I will watch him as I would watch a known thief. If he escapes detection, the fault is mine.] \nHAMLET:  They are coming to the play; I must be idle [pretend to be deranged]:            55\nGet you a place.   \n \nDanish march.  A Flourish.  Enter KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Others.\n   \nKING:  How fares our cousin Hamlet?   \nHAMLET:  Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed; you cannot feed capons so.\n[How fares . . . capons so: Claudius asks how Hamlet is getting along. But Hamlet pretends that he interprets \"fares\" to mean \"eats.\" He then says he eats what the chameleon eats: air. It was believed that chameleons fed on air. However, because the air is fat with promise but empty of actual benefit, says Hamlet, one cannot feed air to capons (castrated male chickens). Hamlet is like a chameleon in that he changes colors—that is, he becomes a different person in front of Claudius. However, in his effort to nail Claudius as the murderer of his father, Hamlet so far has come up only with air but no substance.]   \nKING:  I have nothing with [I do not understand] this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.            60\nHAMLET:  No, nor mine now.  [To POLONIUS.]  My lord, you played once i’ the university, you say?   \nPOLONIUS:  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.   \nHAMLET:  And what did you enact?   \nPOLONIUS:  I did enact Julius Cæsar: I was killed i’ the Capitol; Brutus killed me.   \nHAMLET:  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?            65\nROSENCRANTZ:  Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.   \nQUEEN:  Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.   \nHAMLET:  No, good mother, here’s metal [a precious metal, Ophelia] more attractive.   \nPOLONIUS:  [To the king]  O ho! do you mark that?   \nHAMLET:  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?  [Lying down at Ophelia’s feet.            70\nOPHELIA:  No, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  I mean, my head upon your lap?   \nOPHELIA:  Ay, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Do you think I meant country matters [something indecent]?   \nOPHELIA:  I think nothing, my lord.            75\nHAMLET:  That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.\n[That's . . . legs: After Ophelia says she thinks nothing, Hamlet interprets nothing to mean the numerical symbol 0. Because of its shape, this symbol was sometimes used as a representation of the vulva, the external part of the female sex organ.]  \nOPHELIA:  What is, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Nothing.   \nOPHELIA:  You are merry, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Who, I?            80\nOPHELIA:  Ay, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  O God, your only jig-maker. [O God, who is the original merrymaker.] What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.   \nOPHELIA:  Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. [Since it is so long since my father's death, I will not wear typical black mourning clothes. Let the devil do that. Instead, I will wear a suit of sables (sumptuous black furs) suitable for other occasions.]\nO heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year; but, by ’r lady [by the Blessed Virgin Mary], he must build churches then [churches that are dedicated to his memory], or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is, ‘For, O! for, O! the hobby-horse is forgot.’ [A hobby horse is a wooden figure of a horse. In a dance called the morris, a participant wore a costume resembling a hobby horse. During the dance the hobby horse died, then later rose again and continued the dance. Like the hobby horse, old King Hamlet died but later rose to appear to Hamlet. However, because Hamlet has not yet avenged his father's death, the spirit of the dead king may feel that he \"is forgot.\"]\n \nHautboys [oboes] play.  The dumb-show [part of a play acted without words; pantomime. The next passage presents the dumb show].             85\n \nEnter a King and a Queen, very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her.  She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him.  He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck; lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him.  Anon [soon] comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King’s ears, and exits.  The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.  The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her.  The dead body is carried away.  The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts; she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.  [Exeunt.\n   \nOPHELIA:  What means this, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Marry, this is miching mallecho [sneaky mischief]; it means mischief.   \nOPHELIA:  Belike [probably] this show imports the argument [plot] of the play.   \n \nEnter Prologue.             90\n\nHAMLET:  We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.   \nOPHELIA:  Will he tell us what this show meant?   \nHAMLET:  Ay, or any show that you’ll show him; be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.   \nOPHELIA:  You are naught, you are naught.

Yet, though I distrust,   \nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must [I must not discomfort you];   \nFor women’s fear and love holds quantity,   \nIn neither aught, or in extremity.            115\nNow, what my love is, proof hath made you know;   \nAnd as my love is siz’d, my fear is so.   \nWhere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;   \nWhere little fears grow great, great love grows there.   \nPLAYER KING:  Faith, I must leave thee [I must die], love, and shortly too;            120\nMy operant powers [strength] their functions leave to do:   \nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,   \nHonour’d, belov’d; and haply [perhaps] one as kind   \nFor husband shalt thou—   \nPLAYER QUEEN:  O! confound the rest;            125\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast: [It would be treasonous to remarry.] \nIn second husband let me be accurst;   \nNone wed the second but who kill’d the first.   \nHAMLET:  [Aside.]  Wormwood, wormwood. [Extremely bitter herb used in making absinthe and other alcoholic drinks.]\nPLAYER QUEEN:  The instances that second marriage move [the reasons to marry a second time],            130\nAre base respects of thrift [financial or social gain], but none of love;   \nA second time I kill my husband dead,   \nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.   \nPLAYER KING:  I do believe you think what now you speak;   \nBut what we do determine oft we break.            135\n[I do . . . break: I believe you are sincere about what you vow to do. But people often change their minds and break their vows.]\nPurpose is but the slave to memory,   \nOf violent birth, but poor validity;   \nWhich now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,   \nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\n[Which . . . be: Unripe fruit remains on the tree; ripe fruit falls.]  \nMost necessary ’tis that we forget            140\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt;\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,   \nThe passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\n[What to . . .  lose: In a moment of passion, we promise to do such and such.

Is there no offence in ’t?   \nHAMLET:  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ the world.   \nKING:  What do you call the play?   \nHAMLET:  The Mouse-trap. [The title indicates that Hamlet wishes to use the play to trap, or ensnare, Claudius.] Marry, how? Tropically [Tropically, pronounced with a long O, is an adverb coined from trope, meaning figure of speech. Tropically thus means figuratively]. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke’s name; his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon; ’tis a knavish [mediocre] piece of work: but what of that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince [let the saddle-sore horse wince]; our withers [part of a horse between the shoulders] are unwrung [not pinched; not sore].   \n\n[Hamlet is saying, in effect: \"You and I, King Claudius, are free of guilt.\" But he knows well that the king does feel guilt and will soon wince.]\n \nEnter Player as Lucianus.            185\n\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.   \nOPHELIA:  You are a good chorus, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.\n[I could . . . dallying: I could interpret a scene between you and your lover if I could see you two dallying.] \nOPHELIA:  You are keen, my lord, you are keen.   \nHAMLET:  It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.            190\n[It . . . edge: Because I am keen, like a knife, it would pain you to dull my edge.]\nOPHELIA:  Still better, and worse. [Your wit gets better, but your behavior gets worse.]\nHAMLET:  So you must take your husbands. [That is how you take your husbands: for better or worse.] Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come; the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.   \nLUCIANUS:  Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;   \nConfederate season, else no creature seeing [The night is dark, and no one can see me];   \nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,            195\nWith Hecate’s ban [curse] thrice blasted, thrice infected,   \nThy natural magic and dire property,   \nOn wholesome life usurp immediately.  [Pours the poison into the Sleeper’s ears\n[Thou . . . property: These poisonous midnight weeds—which the Queen of Witchcraft herself has infected with poison—will work their magic and properties to kill this healthy man].   \nHAMLET:  He poisons him i’ the garden for’s estate. His name’s Gonzago; the story is extant [remains current; still told], and writ in very choice Italian. You shall see anon [soon] how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.   \nOPHELIA:  The king rises.            200\nHAMLET:  What! frighted with false fire?  [Is he afraid? It's only a play.]\nQUEEN:  How fares my lord?   \nPOLONIUS:  Give o’er the play.  [Stop the play.]\nKING:  Give me some light: away!   \nALL:  Lights, lights, lights!  [Exeunt all except HAMLET and HORATIO.            205\nHAMLET:  Why, let the stricken deer go weep,   \n            The hart ungalled play; \n[Why . . . play: Why, let the deer wounded in a hunt go weep.

I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?   \nHORATIO:  Very well, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Upon the talk of the poisoning?            220\nHORATIO:  I did very well note him.   \nHAMLET:  Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! [flutes with eight finger holes].  \n    For if the king like not the comedy,   \n    Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy [surely; certainly].   \nCome, some music!            225\n \nRe-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\n   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.   \nHAMLET:  Sir, a whole history.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  The king, sir,—   \nHAMLET:  Ay, sir, what of him?            230\nGUILDENSTERN:  Is in his retirement marvellous distempered [in a bad mood].   \nHAMLET:  With drink, sir?   \nGUILDENSTERN:  No, my lord, rather with choler.\n[Choler: Anger. In the next line (below), Hamlet pretends that Guildenstern means that the king is drunk.]  \nHAMLET:  Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair [Please, sir, you're not making sense.]    235\nHAMLET:  I am tame, sir; pronounce.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.   \nHAMLET:  You are welcome.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer [to make sense in your replies], I will do your mother’s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.   \nHAMLET:  Sir, I cannot.            240\nGUILDENSTERN:  What, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Make you a wholesome answer; my wit’s diseased; but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,—   \nROSENCRANTZ:  Then, thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration [wonder].  \nHAMLET:  O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration? Impart.   \nROSENCRANTZ:  She desires to speak with you in her closet [private chamber] ere [before] you go to bed.            245\nHAMLET:  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?   \nROSENCRANTZ:  My lord, you once did love me.   \nHAMLET:  So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.\n[Pickers and stealers: Hands. Moral guidebooks admonished against using the hands to pick pockets or steal valuables.]\nROSENCRANTZ:  Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.   \nHAMLET:  Sir, I lack advancement.            250\nROSENCRANTZ:  How can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?   \nHAMLET:  Ay, sir, but ‘While the grass grows,’—the proverb is something musty.   \n \nEnter Players, with recorders.\n   \nO! the recorders: let me see one. [Hamlet holds a recorder, a flute with eight finger holes, then turns to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.] To withdraw with you: why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil? [Hamlet is annoyed because Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are sticking so close to him.] \nGUILDENSTERN:  O! my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly [I have been staying by your side because I am concerned about you. Forgive me if I seem unmannerly.].            255\nHAMLET:  I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?   \nGUILDENSTERN:  My lord, I cannot.   \nHAMLET:  I pray you.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  Believe me, I cannot.   \nHAMLET:  I do beseech you.            260\nGUILDENSTERN:  I know no touch of it, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  ’Tis as easy as lying; govern these ventages [finger holes; stops] with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.   \nGUILDENSTERN:  But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.   \nHAMLET:  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me. You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass [range]; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood [by the blood of the crucified Christ], do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.\n[fret me: Double meaning: (1) manipulate me, as a guitarist manipulates the strings of his instrument; (2) vex or annoy me.] \n \nEnter POLONIUS.             265\nGod bless you, sir!   \nPOLONIUS:  My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.   \nHAMLET:  Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?   \nPOLONIUS:  By the mass, and ’tis like a camel, indeed.\n[By the mass: Mild oath. The mass is a Catholic worship rite.]   \nHAMLET:  Methinks it is like a weasel.            270\nPOLONIUS:  It is backed like a weasel.   \nHAMLET:  Or like a whale?   \nPOLONIUS:  Very like a whale.\n[Obviously, the \"mad\" Hamlet is playing games with Polonius. Polonius goes along with the game, pretending to agree with him.]   \nHAMLET:  Then I will come to my mother by and by.  [Aside.]  They fool me to the top of my bent.   [Aloud.]  I will come by and by.   \nPOLONIUS:  I will say so.  [Exit.            275\nHAMLET:  By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.

But he is even more fierce when it comes to protecting a ruler such as you, upon whom so many lives depend. When a monarch falls to ruin, he draws down with him, like a whirlpool, all that is around him.

What if this cursed hand   \nWere thicker than itself with brother’s blood,            50\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens   \nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy   \nBut to confront the visage of offence?\n[Whereto . . . offence: Isn't mercy supposed to bestow itself on the face of the offender?]  \nAnd what’s in prayer but this two-fold force,   \nTo be forestalled, ere we come to fall,            55\nOr pardon’d, being down? Then, I’ll look up;\n[And what's . . . down: Prayer has a twofold purpose: (1) to prevent us from sinning and (2) to pardon us when we do sin.]  \nMy fault is past. But, O! what form of prayer   \nCan serve my turn? ‘Forgive me my foul murder?’   \nThat cannot be; since I am still possess’d   \nOf those effects for which I did the murder,            60\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.   \nMay one be pardon’d and retain the offence?   \nIn the corrupted currents of this world   \nOffence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,   \nAnd oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself            65\nBuys out the law; but ’tis not so above;\n[In the . . . above: In this corrupt world, a criminal can buy a pardon with his wicked prize of gold. But he can't buy off heaven.]   \nThere is no shuffling, there the action lies   \nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d   \nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults   \nTo give in evidence.

That would be scann’d [closely examined]:   \nA villain kills my father; and for that,   \nI, his sole son, do this same villain send   \nTo heaven.            85\nWhy, this is hire and salary, not revenge.   \nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,   \nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;   \nAnd how his audit stands who knows save heaven?\n[In lines 80-89, Hamlet speaks of a new dilemma: if he kills Claudius, Claudius could go to heaven. What kind of revenge would that be? Claudius, on the other hand, killed King Hamlet when the latter had sin on his soul. The old king ended up in purgatory.  But why does Hamlet think Claudius could merit heaven? Like all good Catholic boys, Hamlet believed  only God could judge the goodness or badness of a person, as line 89 suggests.]\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought            90\n’Tis heavy with him.

Sense, sure, you have,\nElse could you not have motion; but sure, that sense   \nIs apoplex’d [paralyzed]; for madness would not err,\nNor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d   \nBut it reserv’d some quantity of choice,            85\nTo serve in such a difference.

O gentle son!   \nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper            140\nSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?   \nHAMLET:  On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!   \nHis form and cause conjoin’d [the ghost's bearing matches his grim purpose], preaching to stones,   \nWould make them capable. Do not look upon me;   \nLest with this piteous action you convert            145\nMy stern effects: then what I have to do   \nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\n[Do not . . . blood: Do not stare at me lest the pitiful sight of you changes me from a bloodthirsty avenger to a tearful mourner.]\nQUEEN:  To whom do you speak this?   \nHAMLET:  Do you see nothing there?   \nQUEEN:  Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.            150\nHAMLET:  Nor did you nothing hear?   \nQUEEN:  No, nothing but ourselves.   \nHAMLET:  Why, look you there! look, how it steals away;   \nMy father, in his habit as he liv’d;   \nLook! where he goes, even now, out at the portal.

But DON'T tell him that I am really not mad. Oh, yes, as queen you would be expected to tell all to the king. He would say that it would be good for you to let him know what's going on. He would have you believe that you could even tell a toad, a bat, and a cat the whole story. Moreover, like the ape in a famous story, you could release the birds from their cage—that is, release the details of our conversation. Remember, though, that in the story the ape entered the cage out of curiousity, then later jumped out and broke his neck.]\n\nQUEEN:  Be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath,   \nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe   \nWhat thou hast said to me.            220\n[Be though . . . me: Be assured that I will not breathe a word of what you said to me.]\nHAMLET:  I must to England; you know that?   \nQUEEN: Alack!

The rabble call him lord;   \nAnd, as the world were now but to begin,            75\nAntiquity forgot, custom not known,   \nThe ratifiers and props of every word,   \nThey cry, ‘Choose we; Laertes shall be king!’   \nCaps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,   \n‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!’            80\nQUEEN:  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!   \nO! this is counter [treasonous], you false Danish dogs!   \nKING:  The doors are broke.

O thou vile king!   \nGive me my father.            90\nQUEEN:  Calmly, good Laertes.   \nLAERTES:  That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard,   \nCries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot   \nEven here, between the chaste unsmirched brow   \nOf my true mother.            95\n[That drop . . . mother: I am as calm as if someone called me a bastard, said my father was cheated on, and branded my mother a whore with a hot iron.]\nKING:  What is the cause, Laertes,   \nThat thy rebellion looks so giant-like?   \nLet him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:   \nThere’s such divinity doth hedge a king,   \nThat treason can but peep to what it would,            100\nActs little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,\n[Let . . . will: Let him have his say, Gertrude. Don't worry about me. God protects kings so that treason cannot act against them.]  \nWhy thou art thus incens’d. Let him go, Gertrude.   \nSpeak, man.   \nLAERTES:  Where is my father?   \nKING:  Dead.            105\nQUEEN:   But not by him.   \nKING:  Let him demand his fill.   \nLAERTES:  How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.   \nTo hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!   \nConscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!            110\nI dare damnation.

O rose of May!   \nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!   \nO heavens! is ’t possible a young maid’s wits   \nShould be as mortal as an old man’s life?   \nNature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine            145\nIt sends some precious instance of itself   \nAfter the thing it loves.   \n[Nature . . . loves: Human nature is generous in its love. Apparently, Ophelia has sent a precious part of herself, her sanity, to her dead father.]\nOPHELIA:\n  They bore him barefac’d [uncovered] on the bier [conveyance that carries a body (with or without a coffin) before burial];\n  Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;\n  And in his grave rain’d many a tear;—\nFare you well, my dove!   \n\nLAERTES:  Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,            150\nIt could not move thus.\n[If you had your wits, you couldn't speak more eloquent words to urge me to gain revenge than you are speaking now.] \nOPHELIA:\n    You must sing, a-down a-down,\n    And you call him a-down-a.\nO how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward [manager of a household] that stole his master’s daughter.   \n\nLAERTES:  This nothing’s more than matter. [These mad words mean more than we can perceive.] \nOPHELIA:  There’s rosemary [for you, Laertes], that’s for remembrance; pray, love, \"remember\": and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.            155\nLAERTES:  A document [study] in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.\n[thoughts . . . fitted: Joining thoughts and remembrance.]\nOPHELIA:  There’s fennel for you [King Claudius], and columbines; there’s rue for you [Queen Gertrude]; and here’s some for me; we may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O! you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy; I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end,—\n    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\n[The plants as symbols: (1) Fennel: flattery or praiseworthiness. (2) Columbine: lovemaking and lust. It was believed that columbine had the power to arouse sexual desire. (3) Rue: repentance and sorrow. Gertrude receives rue for repentance; Ophelia gives it to herself for her grief over the death of her father and perhaps for the loss of Hamlet. Rue was also called herb of grace because priests used it in religious ceremonies. (4) Daisy: innocence, simplicity, and gentleness. (5) Violet: peace, harmony.]\nLAERTES:  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,   \nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.   \n  OPHELIA:\n    And will he not come again?\n    And will he not come again?\n      No, no, he is dead;\n      Go to thy death-bed,\n    He never will come again.\n    His beard was as white as snow\n    All flaxen [white] was his poll [head of hair],\n      He is gone, he is gone,\n      And we cast away moan:\n    God ha’ mercy on his soul!            160\nAnd of all Christian souls!

The queen his mother            15\nLives almost by his looks, and for myself,—   \nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,—   \nShe’s so conjunctive [attached] to my life and soul,   \nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,   \nI could not but by her. The other motive,            20\nWhy to a public count [trial] I might not go,   \nIs the great love the general gender [citizens] bear him;   \nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,   \nWould, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,   \nConvert his gyves [shackles] to graces; so that my arrows,            25\nToo slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,   \nWould have reverted to my bow again,   \nAnd not where I had aim’d them.   \nLAERTES:  And so have I a noble father lost;   \nA sister driven into desperate terms,            30\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,   \nStood challenger on mount of all the age   \nFor her perfections.

In Hamlet's eyes, that quality overshadows all of your other qualities. He envies it. I myself think that quality is not your best.]\nLAERTES:  What part [quality] is that, my lord?   \nKING:  A very riband in the cap of youth,            85\n[riband: ribbon used as a decoration or displayed as a reward of achievement]\nYet needful too; for youth no less becomes   \nThe light and careless livery that it wears   \nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,   \nImporting health and graveness.\n[for . . . graveness: Light and careless clothes are just as appropriate on youth as dignified sables and other dark clothes are on aged persons to reflect their health and graveness.]\nTwo months since   \nHere was a gentleman of Normandy [part of France]:            90\nI’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,   \nAnd they can well [can do well] on horseback; but this gallant [Norman] \nHad witchcraft in ’t [in his horsemanship], he grew unto his seat,   \nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,   \nAs he had been incorps’d and demi-natur’d            95\nWith the brave beast; so far he topp’d my thought,   \nThat I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,   \nCome short of what he did.   \n[As he . . . did: As if he had become part of the brave beast. He performed on that horse far beyond my expectations for him, and I could never duplicate his feats.]\nLAERTES:  A Norman was ’t?   \nKING:  A Norman.            100\nLAERTES:  Upon my life, Lamond.   \nKING:  The very same.   \nLAERTES:  I know him well; he is the brooch indeed   \nAnd gem of all the nation.   \nKING:  He made confession of you,            105\nAnd gave you such a masterly report   \nFor art and exercise in your defence,   \nAnd for your rapier most especially,   \nThat he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed   \nIf one could match you; the scrimers [fencers; swordsmen] of their nation,            110\nHe swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,   \nIf you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his   \nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy   \nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg   \nYour sudden coming o’er, to play with him.            115\nNow, out of this,—   \nLAERTES:  What out of this, my lord?   \nKING:  Laertes, was your father dear to you?   \nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,   \nA face without a heart?            120\nLAERTES:  Why ask you this?   \nKING:  Not that I think you did not love your father,   \nBut that I know love is begun by time,   \nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,   \nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.            125\nThere lives within the very flame of love   \nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,   \nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,   \nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,   \nDies in his own too-much. That we would do,            130\nWe should do when we would, for this ‘would’ changes,   \nAnd hath abatements and delays as many   \nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;   \nAnd then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh,   \nThat hurts by easing. But, to the quick o’ the ulcer;            135\n[But . . . ulcer: But, to get to the point of what's eating at you]\nHamlet comes back; what would you undertake   \nTo show yourself your father’s son in deed   \nMore than in words?   \nLAERTES:  To cut his throat i’ the church.   \nKING:  No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;            140\n[No . . . sanctuarize: Indeed, a murderer such as Hamlet should be fair game even in the sanctuary of a church.]\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,   \nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.   \nHamlet return’d shall know you are come home;   \nWe’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,\n[We'll  . . . excellence: We'll have people praise your excellent swordsmanship] \nAnd set a double varnish on the fame            145\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you, in fine [short], together,   \nAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,   \nMost generous and free from all contriving,   \nWill not peruse [examine] the foils [practice swords blunted on the end]; so that, with ease   \nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose            150\nA sword unbated [sharp, not blunted], and, in a pass of practice [practice lunge] \nRequite [kill] him for your father.   \nLAERTES:  I will do ’t;   \nAnd, for that purpose, I’ll anoint [poison the tip of] my sword.   \nI bought an unction of a mountebank,            155\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,   \nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm [remedy; poultice] so rare,   \nCollected from all simples [medicines] that have virtue   \nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death   \nThat is but scratch’d withal; I’ll touch my point            160\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,   \nIt may be death.   \nKING:  Let’s further think of this;   \nWeigh what convenience both of time and means   \nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,            165\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance\n[our . . . performance: Our purpose—to kill Hamlet—casts suspicion on us]  \n’Twere better not assay’d [tried]; therefore this project   \nShould have a back [backup plan] or second, that might hold,   \nIf this should blast in proof [fail]. Soft! [Pay attention; stand at attention; take note] let me see;   \nWe’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings:            170\n[We'll have bets on the outcome of the fencing match.]\nI ha ’t:   \nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry,—   \nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,—   \nAnd that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him   \nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,            175\nIf he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,   \nOur purpose may hold there. But stay! what noise?  \n[When in . . . there: During the match, dance around so that Hamlet does the same.

O, where?   \nQUEEN:  There is a willow grows aslant [slanting over] a brook,   \nThat shows his hoar [white] leaves in the glassy stream;   \nThere with fantastic garlands did she come,            185\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,   \nThat liberal [foul-mouthed] shepherds give a grosser name,   \nBut our cold maids [modest young women] do dead men’s fingers call them:   \nThere, on the pendent boughs [branches hanging over the water] her coronet weeds   \nClambering to hang, an envious sliver broke,            190\n[her coronet . . . broke: She climbed the tree to hang the crown of wildflowers she had woven. When a spiteful limb broke, she and her flowery trophies fell into the brook.]\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself   \nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,   \nAnd, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;   \nWhich time she chanted snatches of old tunes,   \nAs one incapable of her own distress,            195\nOr like a creature native and indu’d  \nUnto that element; but long it could not be\n[indu'd . . . element: indued or endued: naturally empowered to deal with danger]  \nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,   \nPull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay   \nTo muddy death.            200\nLAERTES:  Alas! then, she is drown’d?   \nQUEEN:  Drown’d, drown’d.   \nLAERTES:  Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,   \nAnd therefore I forbid my tears; but yet   \nIt is our trick, nature her custom holds,            205\nLet shame say what it will; when these are gone   \nThe woman will be out. Adieu [farewell], my lord!   \n[I forbid . . . out: Although I forbid myself to cry, I am crying just the same. It is natural for humans to cry when they confront great sorrow. I don't care if people try to shame me for crying. When my tears stop, I will no longer be a woman and will become a man again.]\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,   \nBut that this folly douts it.

For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly [willingly] it argues an act; and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.  \n[se offendendo: Corruption of se defendendo, Latin legal term for in self-defense. The feminine form is se defendenda, which one would use in reference to Ophelia.]\n[argal: Corruption of ergo, Latin for therefore]\nSECOND CLOWN:  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—  \nFIRST CLOWN:  Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he [willy-nilly: whether willed or not; whether desired or not], he goes; mark you that? but if the water come to him, and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal [therefore], he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.   \nSECOND CLOWN:  But is this law?            10\nFIRST CLOWN:  Ay, marry, is ’t; crowner’s [coroner's] quest [inquest] law.   \nSECOND CLOWN:  Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Why, there thou sayest; and the more pity that great folk should have countenance [the right] in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even [fellow] Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam’s profession. [Genesis 3:2 of the Bible says that the fallen Adam had to till the soil after leaving the Garden of Eden.] \nSECOND CLOWN:  Was he a gentleman?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  A’ was the first that ever bore arms.            15\nSECOND CLOWN:  Why, he had none.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  What! art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam digged; could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—   \nSECOND CLOWN:  Go to.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?   \nSECOND CLOWN:  The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.            20\nFIRST CLOWN:  I like thy wit well, in good faith; the gallows does well, but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill; now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal [therefore], the gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again; come.   \nSECOND CLOWN:  Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Ay, tell me that, and unyoke [complete your work].   \nSECOND CLOWN:  Marry, now I can tell.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  To ’t.            25\nSECOND CLOWN:  Mass, I cannot tell.\n[By the mass: Mild oath. The mass is a Catholic worship rite.]  \n \nEnter HAMLET and HORATIO at a distance.\n   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, ‘a grave-maker:’ the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan [probably a tavern keeper]; fetch me a stoup [pot] of liquor.  [Exit Second Clown.   \n[First Clown digs, and sings.]\n    In youth, when I did love, did love,\n      Methought it was very sweet,\n    To contract [marry], O! the time, for-a my behove [benefit or duty],\n      O! methought there was nothing meet [suitable, fitting, right].\n[In youth . . . meet: The song is based on (but misquotes) a poem by Thomas Vaux (1509-1556) of Harrowden, England, published in Tottel's Miscellany in 1557.]\n   \nHAMLET:  Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?            30\nHORATIO:  Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness [habit].   \nHAMLET:  ’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.\n[the hand . . . sense: Those without a steady job have plenty of time on their hands and thus tend to develop a greater sensitivity than others.] \nFIRST CLOWN:\n    But age, with his stealing steps,\n      Hath claw’d me in his clutch,\n    And hath shipped me intil [into] the land [ground],\n      As if I had never been such.\n[Throws up a skull.   \n   \nHAMLET:  That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once; how the knave jowls [holding the skull by the jaw (jowls), the gravedigger tosses it] it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate [head] of a politician, which this ass now o’er-offices [gets the better of; outranks], one that would circumvent God, might it not?   \nHORATIO:  It might, my lord.            35\nHAMLET:  Or of a courtier, which could say, ‘Good morrow [morning], sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one’s horse, when he meant to beg [borrow] it, might it not?   \nHORATIO:  Ay, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Why, e’en so, and now [it is] my Lady Worm’s [it belongs to the worms]; chapless [its jaw knocked off], and knocked about the mazzard [struck about the head] with a sexton’s [gravedigger's] spade. Here’s fine revolution [turnabout], an [if] we had the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with ’em? mine [my bones] ache to think on ’t.   \n[loggats: Game in which participants stood bones in the ground and tried to knock them down by tossing other bones at them.]\nFIRST CLOWN:\n    A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,\n      For and a shrouding sheet;\n    O! a pit of clay for to be made\n      For such a guest is meet.\n[Throws up another skull.   \n[A pick-axe . . . skull: The First Clown says that all he needs to accommodate a dead guest are a pickax, a shovel, a shroud, and a grave, or \"pit of clay.\"]\n  \nHAMLET:  There’s another; why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities [sly questions] now, his quillets [weak arguments that circumvent the truth with petty reasoning and nitpicking], his cases, his tenures [property titles], and his tricks [deceitful tactics]? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery [legal term for beating or striking someone]? Hum! This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes [binding agreements], his recognizances [pledges to pay money or to perform a certain act], his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries; is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases [does he get to keep no more of his land], and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures [agreements; deeds]? The very conveyance [deeds] of his lands will hardly lie in this box [coffin; grave], and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?            40\nHORATIO:  Not a jot more, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  Is not parchment [material on which legal agreements are written] made of sheep-skins?   \nHORATIO:  Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.   \nHAMLET:  They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave’s this, sir?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Mine, sir,\n    O! a pit of clay for to be made\n      For such a guest is meet.             45\nHAMLET:  I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in ’t.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  You lie out on ’t [outside of it], sir, and therefore it is not yours; for my part, I do not lie [I am not telling a lie] in ’t, and yet it is mine.   \nHAMLET:  Thou dost lie in ’t [You are telling a lie], to be in ’t and say it is thine: ’tis for the dead, not for the quick [living]; therefore thou liest.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  ’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’twill away again, from me to you.\n['Tis . . . you: It's a quick lie, sir, the way it jumps back and forth between me and you.]  \nHAMLET:  What man dost thou dig it for?            50\nFIRST CLOWN:  For no man, sir.   \nHAMLET:  What woman, then?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  For none, neither.   \nHAMLET:  Who is to be buried in ’t?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.            55\nHAMLET:  How absolute [precise] the knave is! we must speak by the card [exact rules], or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the age is grown so picked [bold] that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe [inflamed or sensitive area on the heal of the foot]. How long hast thou been a grave-maker?   \n FIRST CLOWN:  Of all the days i’ the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.   \n[My first day just happened to be the day that our late King Hamlet defeated the late King Fortinbras of Norway.]\nHAMLET:  How long is that since?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that; it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England.   \nHAMLET:  Ay, marry; why was he sent into England?            60\nFIRST CLOWN:  Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, ’tis no great matter there [in England].  \nHAMLET:  Why?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  ’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.   \nHAMLET:  How came he mad?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Very strangely, they say.            65\nHAMLET:  How strangely?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Faith, e’en with losing his wits.   \nHAMLET:  Upon what ground [The gravedigger takes this word to mean country]?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Why, here in Denmark; I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.   \nHAMLET:  How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere [before] he rot?            70\nFIRST CLOWN:  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses [corpses] now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year; a tanner [one who makes leather out of hides] will last you nine year.   \nHAMLET:  Why he more than another?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain you i’ the earth three-and-twenty years.   \nHAMLET:  Whose was it?   \nFIRST CLOWN:  A whoreson mad fellow’s it was: whose do you think it was?            75\nHAMLET:  Nay, I know not.   \nFIRST CLOWN:  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a’ poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the king’s jester.   \nHAMLET:  This!   \nFIRST CLOWN:  E’en that.   \nHAMLET:  Let me see.—[Takes the skull.]—Alas! poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy; he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge [throat; gullet; esophagus] rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes [pranks; tricks; taunts] now? your gambols? [antics; frolics] your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chapfallen [downhearted; dejected]? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick [of makeup], to this favour she must come [she will end up looking like you]; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.            80\nHORATIO:  What’s that, my lord?   \nHAMLET:  Dost thou think Alexander [Alexander the Great (356-323 BC), conquerer of the Persian Empire] looked o’ this fashion i’ the earth?   \nHORATIO:  E’en so.   \nHAMLET:  And smelt so? pah!  [Puts down the skull.   \nHORATIO:  E’en so, my lord.            85\nHAMLET:  To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\n[To what . . . bung-hole:  Consider what  humiliating and degrading  uses  the bodies of human beings are subjected to after death. One can imagine that the ashes of Alexander ended up as a stopper in the hole of a cask or a barrel.]\nHORATIO:  ’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. [You're being cynical.] \nHAMLET:  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough [without exaggerating], and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam, and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?   \nImperious Cæsar, dead and turn’d to clay,   \nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away:            90\nO! that that earth, which kept the world in awe,   \nShould patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw.   \nBut soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.   \n \nEnter Priests, &c., in procession: the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING, QUEEN, their Trains, &c.\n   \nThe queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?            95\nAnd with such maimed [subdued; not glorious] rites? This doth betoken [indicate] \nThe corse [corpse] they follow did with desperate hand   \nFordo [destroy; kill] its own life; ’twas of some estate [high rank; nobility].   \nCouch we awhile, and mark.  [Let's step back and observe.] [Retiring with HORATIO.   \nLAERTES:  What ceremony else?            100\nHAMLET:  That is Laertes,   \nA very noble youth: mark.   \nLAERTES:  What ceremony else?   \nFIRST PRIEST:  Her obsequies [funeral rites] have been as far enlarg’d  \nAs we have warrantise [authority]: her death was doubtful [she apparently killed herself],            105\nAnd, but that great command o’ersways the order,\n[but . . . order: but for the fact that a royal command overruled me]  \nShe should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d   \nTill the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,   \nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her;   \nYet here she is allow’d her virgin crants,            110\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home   \nOf bell and burial.   \n[She . . . burial: She should be buried in unsanctified ground elsewhere till the end of time; instead of praying for her, people should throw pieces of broken pottery, flint (quartz), and pebbles on her body. However, she is allowed flowers and wreaths (crants) indicating she died a virgin, as well as the tolling of a bell and burial in sanctified ground.]\nLAERTES:  Must there no more be done?   \nFIRST PRIEST:.  No more be done:   \nWe should profane the service of the dead,            115\nTo sing a requiem, and such rest to her   \nAs to peace-parted souls.\n[such . . . souls: Other rites normally carried out for those deserving burial in consecrated ground.]  \nLAERTES:  Lay her i’ the earth;   \nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh   \nMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,            120\nA ministering angel shall my sister be,   \nWhen thou liest howling [in hell].  \nHAMLET:  What! the fair Ophelia?   \nQUEEN:  Sweets to the sweet: farewell!  [Scattering flowers.   \nI hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;            125\nI thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,   \nAnd not have strew’d thy grave.   \nLAERTES:  O! treble woe   \nFall ten times treble on that cursed head [Hamlet's] \nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense [sanity]            130\nDepriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth awhile,   \nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.  [Leaps into the grave.   \nNow pile your dust upon the quick [living person] and dead,   \nTill of this flat a mountain you have made,   \nTo o’er-top old Pelion or the skyish head            135\nOf blue Olympus .  \n[Pelion and Olympus: Mountains in Greece.]\nHAMLET:  [Advancing.]  What is he whose grief   \nBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow   \nConjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand   \nLike wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,            140\nHamlet the Dane.  [Leaps into the grave.\n[What is . . . hearers: Who is it that grieves with such emphasis that his words attract the attention of the stars and fill them with wonder? I am the one, Hamlet the Dane.]\nLAERTES:  The devil take thy soul!  [Grapples with him.   \nHAMLET:  Thou pray’st not well.   \nI prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;   \nFor though I am not splenetive [quick-tempered] and rash            145\nYet have I in me something dangerous,   \nWhich let thy wisdom fear. Away thy hand!   \nKING:  Pluck them asunder.  [Separate them.]\nQUEEN:  Hamlet! Hamlet!   \nALL:  Gentlemen,—            150\nHORATIO:  Good my lord, be quiet.  [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.   \nHAMLET:  Why, I will fight with him upon this theme   \nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.   \nQUEEN:  O my son! what theme?   \nHAMLET:  I lov’d Ophelia: forty thousand brothers            155\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,   \nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?   \nKING:  O! he is mad, Laertes.   \nQUEEN:  For love of God, forbear him.   \nHAMLET:  ’Swounds [By Christ's wounds], show me what thou’lt do [thou wilt do for Ophelia]:            160\nWoo ’t weep? woo ’t fight? woo ’t fast? woo ’t tear thyself?   \nWoo ’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?\n[Woo 't . . . crocodile: Would you weep for her?

Dost thou come here to whine;   \nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?   \nBe buried quick [alive] with her, and so will I:            165\nAnd, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw   \nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,   \nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,   \nMake Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou’lt mouth,   \nI’ll rant as well as thou.            170\n[And, if . . . as thou: And, if you speak of mountains filling the grave (lines 134-136), let them throw tons of earth on us until the top of the pile reaches the sun and makes Mount Ossa (a peak in northern Greece) look like a wart. Nay, when you mouth off, I'll mouth off too, as well as you.]\nQUEEN:  This is mere madness:   \nAnd thus a while the fit [outburst of emotion; seizure] will work on him;   \nAnon [soon], as patient as the female dove,   \nWhen that her golden couplets [two eggs] are disclos’d [hatched],   \nHis silence will sit drooping.            175\nHAMLET:  Hear you, sir;   \nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?   \nI lov’d you ever: but it is no matter;   \nLet Hercules himself do what he may,   \nThe cat will mew and dog will have his day.

Rashly,—   \n[bilboes: A bilbo is a bar with fetters that are attached to the feet of prisoner.]\nAnd prais’d be rashness for it, let us know,   \nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well            10\nWhen our deep plots do pall [fail]; and that should teach us   \nThere’s a divinty that shapes [God shapes] our ends,   \nRough-hew them how we will.   \nHORATIO: That is most certain.   \nHAMLET:  Up from my cabin,            15\nMy sea-gown [heavy coat with a high collar] scarf’d [wrapped] about me, in the dark   \nGrop’d I to find out them, had my desire,   \nFinger’d their packet, and in fine withdrew \n[Grop'd . . . packet: I groped around and found the packet containing the message to the king of England]\nTo mine own room again; making so bold—   \nMy fears forgetting manners—to unseal            20\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,   \nO royal knavery! an exact command,   \nLarded with many several sorts of reasons   \nImporting Denmark’s health, and England’s too,   \nWith, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,            25\nThat, on the supervise, no leisure bated,   \nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,   \nMy head should be struck off.\n[an exact . . . struck off: An exact command, interspersed with niceties and greetings from our king to the English king, that I was to be beheaded without delay upon my arrival in England.]\nHORATIO:  Is ’t possible?   \nHAMLET:  Here’s the commission: read it at more leisure.            30\nBut wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?   \nHORATIO:  I beseech you.   \nHAMLET:  Being thus be-netted [ensnared] round with villanies [villainies],—\nEre I could make a prologue to my brains \n[Ere . . . brains: Before I could think over what to do next]\nThey had begun the play,—I sat me down,            35\nDevis’d a new commission, wrote it fair;   \nI once did hold it, as our statists [statesmen] do,   \nA baseness to write fair, and labour’d much   \nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now   \nIt did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know            40\nThe effect of what I wrote?   \nHORATIO:  Ay, good my lord.   \nHAMLET:  An earnest conjuration from the king,   \nAs England was his faithful tributary,   \nAs love between them like the palm should flourish,            45\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear,   \nAnd stand a comma ’tween their amities,   \nAnd many such-like ‘As’es [plural of as] of great charge,   \nThat, on the view and knowing of these contents,   \nWithout debatement further, more or less,            50\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,   \nNot shriving-time allow’d.   \n[An earnest . . . allow'd: I started with a statement from Claudius that England was faithful to Denmark and that love between the two countries should further flourish in a peaceful relationship, with peace joining the two countries as a comma joins clauses and phrases. Then I added many other other sentences and clauses beginning with \"as\" and ended with a command to put the bearers of the message to death immediately, even before they had time to confess their sins to God through a priest.]\nHORATIO:  How was this seal’d?   \nHAMLET:  Why, even in that was heaven ordinant [helpful; giving me guidance].   \nI had my father’s signet [ring with a seal used as a stamp to endorse or authenticate documents] in my purse,            55\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal;   \nFolded the writ up in form of the other,   \nSubscrib’d it, gave ’t th’ impression [stamp], plac’d it safely,   \nThe changeling [substituted document] never known. Now, the next day   \nWas our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent            60\n[what . . . sequent: what followed]\nThou know’st already.   \nHORATIO:  So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t [go to their death].   \nHAMLET:  Why, man, they did make love to this employment; \n[they . . . employment: They relished the idea of taking me to England to die.]\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat   \nDoes by their own insinuation grow.            65\n’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes   \nBetween the pass and fell-incensed points   \nOf mighty opposites.   \n[They are . . . opposites: Their fate does not bother my conscience. Their downfall resulted from their own wilfull interference in my affairs. It's dangerous for lesser mortals like them to become involved in conflicts between opponents holding high positions in the realm.]\nHORATIO:  Why, what a king [Claudius] is this!  [Horatio is really saying, \"Why what an evil king is this!\"]\nHAMLET:  Does it not, thinks ’t thee, stand me now upon—            70\nHe that hath kill’d my king and whor’d my mother,   \nPopp’d in between the election and my hopes [deprived me of being elected king],   \nThrown out his angle for my proper life [hath given the order to kill me],   \nAnd with such cozenage [deceit]—is ’t not perfect conscience   \nTo quit him with this arm? and is ’t not to be damn’d            75\nTo let this canker of our nature come   \nIn further evil?   \n[is 't not . . . evil: Is it not perfectly justified to kill him with this sword? And would I not be damned for allowing this evil man to live to commit more evil?]\nHORATIO:  It must be shortly known to him from England   \nWhat is the issue of the business there. \n[It must . . . there: He will soon find out what happened in England.]\nHAMLET:  It will be short: the interim is mine;            80\nAnd a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One.’\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,   \nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;   \nFor, by the image of my cause, I see   \nThe portraiture of his: I’ll count his favours:            85\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me   \nInto a towering passion.   \n[It will . . . passion: It won't be long before he finds out. But I'll have  time  to act in the interim. I must say, Horatio, that I am sorry I lost my temper when I confronted Laertes at the grave site. He, too, suffered great loss. I'll try to be cordial with him. It was just that his outward display of grief rankled me.]\nHORATIO:  Peace! who comes here?   \n \nEnter OSRIC. [Osric is a courtier, one who is a fixture at the court of a monarch. A typical courtier was at the service of the ruler and often flattered him to gain favors and improve his standing at court.]\n   \nOSRIC:  Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.            90\nHAMLET:  I humbly thank you, sir.  [Aside to HORATIO.]  Dost know this water-fly [insignificant creature]?   \nHORATIO:  [Aside to HAMLET.]  No, my good lord.   \nHAMLET:  [Aside to HORATIO.]  Thy state [of not knowing Osric] is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess: ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\n[let a beast . . . dirt: When a man—regardless of his human worth—becomes lord of something, he gains favor at court and dines with the king. He's nothing but a crow (chough). But, as I say, he has lots of dirt (land)].  \nOSRIC:  Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.   \nHAMLET:  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.            95\n[Your . . . head: Put your hat on. It's for the head. Osric had removed his hat to show his respect (probably insincere) for Prince Hamlet.]\nOSRIC:  I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.   \nHAMLET:  No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is northerly.   \nOSRIC:  It is indifferent [somewhat] cold, my lord, indeed.   \nHAMLET:  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.   \nOSRIC:  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as ’twere, I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—            100\nHAMLET:  I beseech you, remember—  [HAMLET moves him to put on his hat.   \nOSRIC:  Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences [qualities that set him apart from others], of very soft society [gentle upbringing] and great showing [impressive appearance]; indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card [standard] or calendar [example] of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent [complete package] of what part a gentleman would see [of what a gentleman should be].   \nHAMLET:  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.\n[Sir . . . nothing more: Sir, your description of him is glowing. And I realize that trying to present an inventory of all of his good qualities would make you dizzy. If he were the captain of a ship, we couldn't catch him no matter how much we yawed (swerved) this way or that. Truly, in praising him, I must say he is a great soul. He is unique. When he looks into a mirror, he sees the only one who can equal him. Everyone else who would follow him walks in his shadow (umbrage).] \nOSRIC:  Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.   \nHAMLET:  The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?            105\n[The concernancy . . . breath: Why are we talking about this man?]\nOSRIC:  Sir?   \nHORATIO:  Is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue? [Can't you talk to him in plainer language?] You will do ’t, sir, really.   \nHAMLET:  What imports the nomination of this gentleman? [What is the purpose of bringing up this subject?] \nOSRIC:  Of Laertes?   \nHORATIO:  His purse is empty already; all ’s golden words are spent.            110\nHAMLET:  Of him, sir.   \nOSRIC:  I know you are not ignorant—   \nHAMLET:  I would you did, sir; in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir.\n[I would . . . me: I'm glad you know that, sir. But I'm not satisfied.]  \nOSRIC:  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—   \nHAMLET:  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.            115\nOSRIC:  I mean, sir, for his weapon [fencing skill]; but in the imputation [reputation] laid on him by them, in his meed [ability] he’s unfellowed [unrivaled].   \nHAMLET:  What’s his weapon?   \nOSRIC:  Rapier and dagger.   \nHAMLET:  That’s two of his weapons; but, well.   \nOSRIC:  The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary [north African] horses; against the which he has imponed [pledged; staked], as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards [daggers], with their assigns [accessories], as girdle [belt], hangers [straps attached to the belt to hold up a scabbard], and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.            120\nHAMLET:  What call you the carriages?   \nHORATIO:  I knew you must be edified by the margent [be curious about the meaning of some words], ere you had done.   \nOSRIC:  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.   \nHAMLET:  The phrase would be more german [germane; pertinent] to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides [if you were talking about cannons instead of swords]; I would it might be hangers till then. But, on; six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this ‘imponed,’ as you call it?   \nOSRIC:  The king, sir, hath laid [wagered], that in a dozen passes between yourself and him [Laertes], he shall not exceed you three hits [shall not defeat you by no more than three hits; in other words, the king supposedly is betting on Hamlet if Laertes spots the prince three hits]; he hath laid on twelve for nine [twelve hits for Laertes to nine hits for Hamlet], and it would come to immediate trial [a match held right now], if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.            125\nHAMLET:  How if I answer no?   \nOSRIC:  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. [Let me be clear, my lord. I'm talking about testing yourself in a competition against Laertes.] \nHAMLET:  Sir, I will walk here in the hall; if it please his majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\n[Sir, I will . . . odd hits: Sir, I will walk here in the hall. It's the time of day when I like to get exercise. Meanwhile, let the preparation begin for the fencing match. I will try to fight to make the king win his bet. If I fail, I will suffer only a little shame and some hits from Laertes' sword.]   \nOSRIC:  Shall I re-deliver you so? [Shall I quote you on that?] \nHAMLET:  To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.            130\n[To . . . will: You may tell him the gist of what I said with whatever fancy words you'd like to add.]\nOSRIC:  I commend my duty to your lordship.   \nHAMLET:  Yours, yours.  [Exit OSRIC.]  He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for ’s turn.\n[He does . . . turn: He does well to commend his duty. No one else will commend him for anything.]  \nHORATIO:  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\n[This . . . head: The lapwing, a small bird, can move around moments after it hatches. It may run off even when pieces of its shell are still attached to its body.]\nHAMLET:  He did comply with his dug before he sucked it. [He used to praise the nipple of his mother (or wet nurse) before he sucked it.] Thus has he—and many more of the same bevy [kind], that I know the drossy [worthless; trivial] age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.\n[only got . . . out: His only talent is to act like everyone else and speak the same words (yesty collection) that carry his kind through their conversations and opinions, winnowed of substance. They try to attach great meaning to their words; but the words are full of air, like bubbles.]\n \nEnter a Lord.             135\n\nLord.  My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall; he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play [fence] with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.\n[his majesty . . . time: After the king sent Osric to deliver his message to you, Osric reported back to the king and now asks you to meet him in the hall. He wishes to know whether you want to have the fencing match now or later.]  \nHAMLET:  I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king’s pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now, or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.   \nLord.  The king, and queen, and all are coming down.   \nHAMLET:  In happy time. [That suits me well.] \nLord.  The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment [gentle words or treatment] to Laertes before you fall to play.            140\nHAMLET:  She well instructs me.  [Exit Lord.   \nHORATIO:  You will lose this wager, my lord.   \nHAMLET:  I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart; but it is no matter.   \n[But . . . heart: But be aware that I feel a bit uneasy in my heart.]\nHORATIO:  Nay, good my lord,—   \nHAMLET:  It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.            145\n[It is . . . woman: It's really nothing—rather like a misgiving that would perhaps trouble a woman.]\nHORATIO:  If your mind dislike any thing, obey it; I will forestall their repair hither [stop them from coming], and say you are not fit.   \nHAMLET:  Not a whit, we defy augury; there’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is ’t to leave betimes? Let be. \n[Not a . . . let be: No, don't do that. I defy omens or foreboding feelings. After all, it is God who oversees our destiny. If a sparrow dies now, it was meant by heaven to die now and not later. If the sparrow does not die now, it was meant by heaven to die later. (See Matthew 10:29 in the New Testament of the Bible.) What is important is to be prepared for whatever happens to you. No man retains anything of what he leaves behind when he dies. So what does it matter if a man dies an early death? Let things stand as they are.]\n \nEnter KING, QUEEN, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c.\n   \nKING:  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.  [The KING puts the hand of LAERTES into that of HAMLET.   \nHAMLET:  Give me your pardon, sir; I’ve done you wrong;            150\nBut pardon ’t, as you are a gentleman.   \nThis presence knows,   \nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punish’d   \nWith sore distraction [mental anguish]. What I have done,   \nThat might your nature, honour and exception            155\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.   \nWas ’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet:   \nIf Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,   \nAnd when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,   \nThen Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.            160\nWho does it then? His madness. If ’t be so,   \nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;   \nHis madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.   \nSir, in this audience,   \nLet my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil            165\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,   \nThat I have shot mine arrow o’er the house,   \nAnd hurt my brother.   \n[That I . . . brother: That I shot an arrow over a house, unaware that my brother was on the other side, and unintentionally hit and injured him.]\nLAERTES:  I am satisfied in nature [temperament; feelings],   \nWhose motive, in this case, should stir me most            170\nTo my revenge; but in my terms of honour   \nI stand aloof, and will no reconcilement, \n[I stand . . . reconcilement: I am not satisfied and will not reconcile with you.] \nTill by some elder masters [old wise men], of known honour,   \nI have a voice and precedent of peace,   \nTo keep my name ungor’d. But till that time,            175\nI do receive your offer’d love like love,   \nAnd will not wrong it.\nHAMLET:  I embrace it freely;   \nAnd will this brother’s wager frankly play.   \nGive us the foils [thin, flexible swords with blunted tips]. Come on.            180\nLAERTES:  Come, one for me.   \nHAMLET:  I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance   \nYour skill shall, like a star i’ the darkest night,   \nStick fiery off indeed.   \n[I'll be . . . indeed: I'll be a poor comparison to you, Laertes. Since I lack the talents that you have acquired, your skill will shine like a fiery star in a dark sky.]\nLAERTES:  You mock me, sir. [Laertes thinks Hamlet is insincere.]           185\nHAMLET:  No, by this hand.   \nKING:  Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,   \nYou know the wager?   \nHAMLET:  Very well, my lord;   \nYour Grace hath laid the odds o’ the weaker side.            190\nKING:  I do not fear it; I have seen you both;   \nBut since he is better’d [he has the greater skill], we have therefore odds.   \nLAERTES:  This is too heavy; let me see another.   \nHAMLET:  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?   \nOSRIC:  Ay, my good lord.  [They prepare to play.            195\nKING:  Set me the stoups [pots] of wine upon that table.   \nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,   \nOr quit [strikes back] in answer of the third exchange,   \nLet all the battlements their ordnance [cannons] fire;   \nThe king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath [health];            200\nAnd in the cup [that Hamlet drinks from] an union [pearl] shall he throw,   \nRicher than that which four successive kings   \nIn Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;   \nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,   \nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,            205\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,   \n‘Now the king drinks to Hamlet!’ Come, begin;   \nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.   \nHAMLET:  Come on, sir.   \nLAERTES:  Come, my lord.  [They play.            210\nHAMLET:  One.   \nLAERTES:   No.   \nHAMLET:   Judgment.   \nOSRIC:  A hit, a very palpable hit.   \nLAERTES:  Well; again.            215\nKING:  Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;   \nHere’s to thy health. Give him the cup.  [Trumpets sound; and cannon shot off within.   \nHAMLET:  I’ll play this bout first; set it by a while.   \nCome.—[They play.]  Another hit; what say you?   \nLAERTES:  A touch, a touch, I do confess.            220\nKING:  Our son shall win.   \nQUEEN:  He’s fat, and scant of breath.   \nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;   \nThe queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. [She picks up the poisoned cup, the one with the pearl, that the king intended for Hamlet.] \nHAMLET:  Good madam!            225\nKING:  Gertrude, do not drink.   \nQUEEN:  I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. [Drinks. \nKING:  [Aside.]  It is the poison’d cup! it is too late.   \nHAMLET:  I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.   \nQUEEN:  Come, let me wipe thy face.            230\nLAERTES:  My lord, I’ll hit him now.   \nKING:  I do not think ’t.   \nLAERTES:  [Aside.]  And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.   \nHAMLET:  Come, for the third, Laertes. You but dally;   \nI pray you, pass with your best violence.            235\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me [you are toying with me].   \nLAERTES:  Say you so? come on.  [They play.   \nOSRIC:  Nothing, neither way.   \nLAERTES:  Have at you now.  [LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES.   \nKING:  Part them! they are incens’d [going too far].            240\nHAMLET:  Nay, come, again.  [The QUEEN falls.   \nOSRIC:   Look to the queen there, ho!   \nHORATIO:  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?   \nOSRIC:  How is it, Laertes?   \nLAERTES:  Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe [as a man snared by his own trap], Osric;            245\nI am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.   \nHAMLET:  How does the queen?   \nKING:  She swounds [faints, swoons] to see them bleed.   \nQUEEN:  No, no, the drink, the drink,—O my dear Hamlet!   \nThe drink, the drink; I am poison’d.  [Dies.            250\nHAMLET:  O villany! Ho! let the door be lock’d:   \nTreachery! seek it out.  [LAERTES falls.   \nLAERTES:  It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;   \nNo medicine in the world can do thee good;   \nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;            255\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,   \nUnbated [not capped or blunted] and envenom’d. The foul practice   \nHath turn’d itself on me; lo! here I lie,   \nNever to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.   \nI can no more. The king, the king’s to blame.            260\nHAMLET:  The point envenom’d too!—   \nThen, venom, to thy work.  [Stabs the KING.   \nALL:  Treason! treason!   \nKING:  O! yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt [only wounded].   \nHAMLET:  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,            265\nDrink off this potion;—is thy union [pearl] here?   \nFollow my mother.  [KING dies.   \nLAERTES:  He [the king] is justly serv’d;   \nIt is a poison temper’d by himself.   \nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:            270\nMine and my father’s death come not upon thee,   \nNor thine on me!  [Dies.   \nHAMLET:  Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.   \nI am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!   \nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,            275\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,   \nHad I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,   \nIs strict in his arrest,—O! I could tell you—   \nBut let it be. Horatio, I am dead;   \nThou liv’st; report me and my cause aright            280\nTo the unsatisfied.   \nHORATIO:  Never believe it;   \nI am more an antique Roman [Romans were famous for committing suicide after a reversal of fortune] than a Dane:   \nHere’s yet some liquor left.   \nHAMLET:  As thou’rt a man,            285\nGive me the cup: let go; by heaven, I’ll have ’t.   \nO God! Horatio, what a wounded name,   \nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.   \nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,   \nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,            290\n[Absent . . . awhile: Absent (pronounced ab SENT) thee from sweet death awhile.]\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,   \nTo tell my story.  [March afar off, and shot within.   \n        What war-like noise is this?   \nOSRIC:  Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, \nTo the ambassadors of England gives            295\nThis war-like volley [salute].   \nHAMLET:   O! I die, Horatio;   \nThe potent poison quite o’er-crows [overcomes] my spirit:   \nI cannot live to hear the news from England,   \nBut I do prophesy the election [to choose the new Danish king] lights            300\nOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;   \nSo tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,   \nWhich have solicited—The rest is silence.  [Dies. \n[So tell . . . solicited: So tell him about the recent events, whether of greater or lesser importance, that influenced my actions.]\nHORATIO:  Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet prince,   \nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!            305\nWhy does the drum come hither?  [March within.   \n \nEnter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and Others.\n   \nFORTINBRAS:  Where is this sight?   \nHORATIO:  What is it ye would see?   \nIf aught [anything] of woe or wonder, cease your search.            310\n[If aught . . . search]: If you mean anything tragic or terrible to behold, this is the place.]\nFORTINBRAS:  This quarry [harvest of animals hunted down, killed, and piled in a heap] cries on havoc [disorder; chaos; destruction]. O proud death!\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,   \nThat thou so many princes at a shot   \nSo bloodily hast struck?\n[O proud . . . struck: O death! You must be planning a great banquet in your eternal abode, considering that you took the lives of so many royal persons in a single moment.]\nFIRST AMBASSADOR:  The sight is dismal;            315\nAnd our affairs from England come too late:   \nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,   \nTo tell him [King Claudius] his commandment is fulfill’d,   \nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.   \nWhere should we have our thanks?            320\n[Where . . . thanks: Since the king is dead, he cannot thank us for delivering our message.]\nHORATIO:  Not from his mouth,   \nHad it the ability of life to thank you:   \nHe never gave commandment for their death.   \nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\n[But . . . question: But since you wonder what happened here that spilled so much blood]  \nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England,            325\nAre here arriv’d, give order that these bodies   \nHigh on a stage be placed to the view;   \nAnd let me speak to the yet unknowing world   \nHow these things came about: so shall you hear   \nOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,            330\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters;   \nOf deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause,   \nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook   \nFall’n on the inventors’ heads; all this can I  \nTruly deliver.            335\n[And in . . . deliver: And, ironically, murderous plots that went awry and killed the very persons who hatched them. I can tell you the whole story.]\nFORTINBRAS:  Let us haste to hear it,   \nAnd call the noblest to the audience [call the noblemen hereabouts to listen].   \nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune;   \nI have some rights of memory [entitlements] in this kingdom,   \nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.            340\n[Which . . . me: Which I now plan to claim]\nHORATIO:  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,   \nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:   \nBut let this same be presently perform’d,   \nEven while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance   \nOn plots and errors happen.            345\n[Of that . . . happen: On this matter I'd like to disclose to you Hamlet's last wishes, even at this upsetting time, so that we can avoid further plots and upheavals.]\nFORTINBRAS:  Let four captains   \nBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;   \nFor he was likely, had he been put on,   \nTo have prov’d most royally: and, for his passage,   \n[For he . . . royally: For he was likely, had he lived, to have been a great ruler.]\nThe soldiers’ music and the rites of war            350\nSpeak loudly for him.   \nTake up the bodies: such a sight as this   \nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\n[Such a sight . . . amiss: This site is appropriate for a battlefield, but not for a hall in a king's castle.]\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.  [A dead march.  Exeunt, bearing off the bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off.",
